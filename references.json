  {"id":"acharya22","abstract":"Neurostimulation technologies have seen a recent surge in interest from the neuroscience and controls communities alike due to their proven potential to treat conditions such as Parkinson's Disease, and depression. The provided stimulation can be of different types, such as electric, and optogenetic, and is generally applied to a specific region of the brain in order to drive the local and/or global dynamics to a desired state of (in)activity. However, an underlying theoretical understanding of the efficacy of neurostimulation is still lacking. From a control-theoretic perspective, it is important to understand how each stimulus modality interacts with the complex brain network in order to assess the controllability of the system and develop neurophysiologically relevant computational models that can be used to design the stimulation profile in a closed-loop manner. In this paper, we review the computational modeling studies of (i) deep brain stimulation, (ii) transcranial magnetic stimulation, (iii) direct current stimulation, (iv) transcranial electrical stimulation, and (v) optogenetics as five of the most popular neurostimulation technologies in research and clinical settings. For each technology, we split the reviewed studies into (a)theory-driven biophysical models capturing the low-level physics of the interactions between the stimulation source and neuronal tissue, (b) data-driven stimulus-response models which capture the end-to-end effects of stimulation on various biomarkers of interest and (c) data-driven dynamical system models that extract the precise dynamics of the brain's response to neurostimulation from neural data. While our focus is particularly on the latter category due to their greater utility in control design, we review key works in the former two categories as the basis and context in which dynamical system models have been and will be developed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Acharya","given":"Gagan"},{"family":"Ruf","given":"Sebastian F."},{"family":"Nozari","given":"Erfan"}],"citation-key":"acharya22","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2210.15957","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,28]]},"number":"arXiv:2210.15957","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Brain Modeling for Control: A Review","title-short":"Brain Modeling for Control","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15957"},
  {"id":"adesnik21","abstract":"Optogenetics ushered in a revolution in how neuroscientists interrogate brain function. Because of technical limitations, the majority of optogenetic studies have used low spatial resolution activation schemes that limit the types of perturbations that can be made. However, neural activity manipulations at finer spatial scales are likely to be important to more fully understand neural computation. Spatially precise multiphoton holographic optogenetics promises to address this challenge and opens up many new classes of experiments that were not previously possible. More specifically, by offering the ability to recreate extremely specific neural activity patterns in both space and time in functionally defined ensembles of neurons, multiphoton holographic optogenetics could allow neuroscientists to reveal fundamental aspects of the neural codes for sensation, cognition and behavior that have been beyond reach. This Review summarizes recent advances in multiphoton holographic optogenetics that substantially expand its capabilities, highlights outstanding technical challenges and provides an overview of the classes of experiments it can execute to test and validate key theoretical models of brain function. Multiphoton holographic optogenetics could substantially accelerate the pace of neuroscience discovery by helping to close the loop between experimental and theoretical neuroscience, leading to fundamental new insights into nervous system function and disorder.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Adesnik","given":"Hillel"},{"family":"Abdeladim","given":"Lamiae"}],"citation-key":"adesnik21","container-title":"Nature Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Nat Neurosci","DOI":"10.1038/s41593-021-00902-9","ISSN":"1546-1726","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature America, Inc.","number":"10","page":"1356-1366","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Probing neural codes with two-photon holographic optogenetics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00902-9","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"andalman19","abstract":"Prolonged behavioral challenges can cause animals to switch from active to passive coping strategies to manage effort-expenditure during stress; such normally adaptive behavioral state transitions can become maladaptive in psychiatric disorders such as depression. The underlying neuronal dynamics and brainwide interactions important for passive coping have remained unclear. Here, we develop a paradigm to study these behavioral state transitions at cellular-resolution across the entire vertebrate brain. Using brainwide imaging in zebrafish, we observed that the transition to passive coping is manifested by progressive activation of neurons in the ventral (lateral) habenula. Activation of these ventral-habenula neurons suppressed downstream neurons in the serotonergic raphe nucleus and caused behavioral passivity, whereas inhibition of these neurons prevented passivity. Data-driven recurrent neural network modeling pointed to altered intra-habenula interactions as a contributory mechanism. These results demonstrate ongoing encoding of experience features in the habenula, which guides recruitment of downstream networks and imposes a passive coping behavioral strategy. Brainwide imaging in zebrafish and network modeling reveal that switching from active to passive coping state arises from progressive activation of habenular neurons in response to behavioral challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Andalman","given":"Aaron S."},{"family":"Burns","given":"Vanessa M."},{"family":"Lovett-Barron","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Broxton","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Poole","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Samuel J."},{"family":"Grosenick","given":"Logan"},{"family":"Lerner","given":"Talia N."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ritchie"},{"family":"Benster","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Mourrain","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Levoy","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Rajan","given":"Kanaka"},{"family":"Deisseroth","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"andalman19","container-title":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.037","ISSN":"10974172","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]]},"page":"970-985.e20","publisher":"Cell Press","title":"Neuronal Dynamics Regulating Brain and Behavioral State Transitions","type":"article-journal","volume":"177"},
  {"id":"antolik13","abstract":"The increasing availability of computational resources is enabling more detailed, realistic modeling in computational neuroscience, resulting in a shift toward more heterogeneous models of neuronal circuits, and employment of complex experimental protocols. This poses a challenge for existing tool chains, as the set of tools involved in a typical modeler’s workflow is expanding concomitantly, with growing complexity in the metadata flowing between them. For many parts of the workflow, a range of tools is available; however, numerous areas lack dedicated tools, while integration of existing tools is limited. This forces modelers to either handle the workflow manually, leading to errors, or to write substantial amounts of code to automate parts of the workflow, in both cases reducing their productivity. To address these issues, we have developed Mozaik: a workflow system for spiking neuronal network simulations written in Python. Mozaik integrates model, experiment and stimulation specification, simulation execution, data storage, data analysis and visualization into a single automated workflow, ensuring that all relevant metadata are available to all workflow components. It is based on several existing tools, including PyNN, Neo, and Matplotlib. It offers a declarative way to specify models and recording configurations using hierarchically organized configuration files. Mozaik automatically records all data together with all relevant metadata about the experimental context, allowing automation of the analysis and visualization stages. Mozaik has a modular architecture, and the existing modules are designed to be extensible with minimal programming effort. Mozaik increases the productivity of running virtual experiments on highly structured neuronal networks by automating the entire experimental cycle, while increasing the reliability of modeling studies by relieving the user from manual handling of the flow of metadata between the individual workflow stages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Antolík","given":"Ján"},{"family":"Davison","given":"Andrew P."}],"citation-key":"antolik13","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroinformatics","DOI":"10.3389/fninf.2013.00034","ISSN":"16625196","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"page":"34","publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Integrated workflows for spiking neuronal network simulations","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"antolik21","abstract":"The neural encoding of visual features in primary visual cortex (V1) is well understood, with strong correlates to low-level perception, making V1 a strong candidate for vision restoration through neuroprosthetics. However, the functional relevance of neural dynamics evoked through external stimulation directly imposed at the cortical level is poorly understood. Furthermore, protocols for designing cortical stimulation patterns that would induce a naturalistic perception of the encoded stimuli have not yet been established. Here, we demonstrate a proof of concept by solving these issues through a computational model, combining (1) a large-scale spiking neural network model of cat V1 and (2) a virtual prosthetic system transcoding the visual input into tailored light-stimulation patterns which drive in situ the optogenetically modified cortical tissue. Using such virtual experiments, we design a protocol for translating simple Fourier contrasted stimuli (gratings) into activation patterns of the optogenetic matrix stimulator. We then quantify the relationship between spatial configuration of the imposed light pattern and the induced cortical activity. Our simulations in the absence of visual drive (simulated blindness) show that optogenetic stimulation with a spatial resolution as low as 100 μ m, and light intensity as weak as 10 16 photons/s/cm2 is sufficient to evoke activity patterns in V1 close to those evoked by normal vision.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Antolik","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Sabatier","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Galle","given":"Charlie"},{"family":"Frégnac","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Benosman","given":"Ryad"}],"citation-key":"antolik21","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-88960-8","ISBN":"0123456789","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,24]]},"page":"1-18","PMID":"34031442","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","title":"Assessment of optogenetically-driven strategies for prosthetic restoration of cortical vision in large-scale neural simulation of V1","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88960-8","volume":"11"},

Using focal illumination of the cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb, we demonstrate a highly reproducible, light-dependent activation of neurons and precise control of firing frequency in vivo. To test the feasibility of mapping neural circuits, we exploited the circuitry formed between the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex in anesthetized mice. In the olfactory bulb, individual mitral cells fired action potentials in response to light, and their firing rate was not influenced by costimulated glomeruli. However, in piriform cortex, the activity of target neurons increased as larger areas of the bulb were illuminated to recruit additional glomeruli. These results support a model of olfactory processing that is dependent upon mitral cell convergence and integration onto cortical cells. More broadly, these findings demonstrate a system for precise manipulation of neural activity in the intact mammalian brain with light and illustrate the use of ChR2 mice in exploring functional connectivity of complex neural circuits in vivo. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

An accurate model for inhibition of spiking in these opsins expressed hippocampal neurons that includes the important rebound activity of chloride ions across the membrane has been formulated. The effect of various parameters including irradiance, pulse width, frequency, opsin-expression density and chloride concentration has been studied in detail. Theoretical simulations are in very good agreement with reported experimental results. The chloride concentration gradient directly affects the photocurrent and inhibition capacity in all three variants. eNpHR3.0 shows smallest inhibitory post-synaptic potential plateau at higher frequencies.

Good practical values of photostimulation parameters have been obtained empirically for peak photocurrent, time delay and 100% spiking inhibition, at continuous and pulsed illumination. Under continuous illumination, complete inhibition of neural activity in Jaws-expressing neurons takes place at minimum irradiance of 0.2 mW mm-2 and expression density of 0.2 mS cm-2, whereas for pulsed stimulation, it is at minimum irradiance of 0.6 mW mm-2 and 5 ms pulse width, at 10 Hz.

  {"id":"bansal21a","abstract":"Objective. Optogenetics has emerged as a promising technique for neural prosthetics, especially retinal prostheses, with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Newly discovered opsins with high light sensitivity and fast temporal kinetics can provide sufficient temporal resolution at safe light powers and overcome the limitations of presently used opsins. It is also important to formulate accurate mathematical models for optogenetic retinal prostheses, which can facilitate optimization of photostimulation factors to improve the performance. Approach. A detailed theoretical analysis of optogenetic excitation of model retinal ganglion neurons (RGNs) and hippocampal neurons expressed with already tested opsins for retinal prostheses, namely, ChR2, ReaChR and ChrimsonR, and also with recently discovered potent opsins CsChrimson, bReaChES and ChRmine, was carried out. Main results. Under continuous illumination, ChRmine-expressing RGNs begin to respond at very low irradiances ∼10-4 mW mm-2, and evoke firing upto ∼280 Hz, highest among other opsin-expressing RGNs, at 10-2 mW mm-2. Under pulsed illumination at randomized photon fluxes, ChRmine-expressing RGNs respond to changes in pulse to pulse irradiances upto four logs, although very bright pulses >1014 photons mm-2 s-1 block firing in these neurons. The minimum irradiance threshold for ChRmine-expressing RGNs is lower by two orders of magnitude, whereas, the first spike latency in ChRmine-expressing RGNs is shorter by an order of magnitude, alongwith stable latency of subsequest spikes compared to others. Further, a good set of photostimulation parameters were determined to achieve high-frequency control with single spike resolution at minimal power. Although ChrimsonR enables spiking upto 100 Hz in RGNs, it requires very high irradiances. ChRmine provides control at light powers that are two orders of magnitude smaller than that required with experimentally studied opsins, while maintaining single spike temporal resolution upto 40 Hz.

We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive fora wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive.

Applying this method to the ground-based behaviour of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we find that flies perform stereotyped actions roughly 50% of the time, discovering over 100 distinguishable, stereotyped behavioural states.

  {"id":"berndt16","abstract":"The structure-guided design of chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins has illuminated mechanisms underlying ion selectivity of this remarkable family of light-activated ion channels. The first generation of chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins, guided in part by development of a structure-informed electrostatic model for pore selectivity, included both the introduction of amino acids with positively charged side chains into the ion conduction pathway and the removal of residues hypothesized to support negatively charged binding sites for cations. Engineered channels indeed became chloride selective, reversing near -65 mV and enabling a new kind of optogenetic inhibition; however, these first-generation chloride-conducting channels displayed small photocurrents and were not tested for optogenetic inhibition of behavior. Here we report the validation and further development of the channelrhodopsin pore model via crystal structure-guided engineering of next-generation light-activated chloride channels (iC++) and a bistable variant (SwiChR++) with net photocurrents increased more than 15-fold under physiological conditions, reversal potential further decreased by another ~15 mV, inhibition of spiking faithfully tracking chloride gradients and intrinsic cell properties, strong expression in vivo, and the initial microbial opsin channel-inhibitor-based control of freely moving behavior. We further show that inhibition by light-gated chloride channels is mediated mainly by shunting effects, which exert optogenetic control much more efficiently than the hyperpolarization induced by light-activated chloride pumps. The design and functional features of these next-generation chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins provide both chronic and acute timescale tools for reversible optogenetic inhibition, confirm fundamental predictions of the ion selectivity model, and further elucidate electrostatic and steric structure- function relationships of the light-gated pore.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Berndt","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Soo Yeun"},{"family":"Wietek","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Ramakrishnan","given":"Charu"},{"family":"Steinberg","given":"Elizabeth E."},{"family":"Rashid","given":"Asim J."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hoseok"},{"family":"Park","given":"Sungmo"},{"family":"Santoro","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Frankland","given":"Paul W."},{"family":"Iyer","given":"Shrivats M."},{"family":"Pak","given":"Sally"},{"family":"Ährlund-Richter","given":"Sofie"},{"family":"Delp","given":"Scott L."},{"family":"Malenka","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Josselyn","given":"Sheena A."},{"family":"Carlén","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Hegemann","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Deisseroth","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"berndt16","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1523341113","ISSN":"10916490","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,26]]},"page":"822-829","PMID":"26699459","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","title":"Structural foundations of optogenetics: Determinants of channelrhodopsin ion selectivity","type":"article-journal","volume":"113"},
  {"id":"bettencourt08","abstract":"In the dynamic clamp technique, a typically nonlinear feedback system delivers electrical current to an excitable cell that represents the actions of \"virtual\" ion channels (e.g., channels that are gated by local membrane potential or by electrical activity in neighboring biological or virtual neurons). Since the conception of this technique, there have been a number of different implementations of dynamic clamp systems, each with differing levels of flexibility and performance. Embedded hardware-based systems typically offer feedback that is very fast and precisely timed, but these systems are often expensive and sometimes inflexible. PC-based systems, on the other hand, allow the user to write software that defines an arbitrarily complex feedback system, but real-time performance in PC-based systems can be deteriorated by imperfect real-time performance. Here, we systematically evaluate the performance requirements for artificial dynamic clamp knock-in of transient sodium and delayed rectifier potassium conductances. Specifically, we examine the effects of controller time step duration, differential equation integration method, jitter (variability in time step), and latency (the time lag from reading inputs to updating outputs). Each of these control system flaws is artificially introduced in both simulated and real dynamic clamp experiments. We demonstrate that each of these errors affect dynamic clamp accuracy in a way that depends on the time constants and stiffness of the differential equations being solved. In simulations, time steps above 0.2 ms lead to catastrophic alteration of spike shape, but the frequency-current relationship is much more robust. Latency (the part of the time step that occurs between measuring membrane potential and injecting re-calculated membrane current) is a crucial factor as well.

  {"id":"bolus21","abstract":"Objective. The rapid acceleration of tools for recording neuronal populations and targeted optogenetic manipulation has enabled real-time, feedback control of neuronal circuits in the brain. Continuously-graded control of measured neuronal activity poses a wide range of technical challenges, which we address through a combination of optogenetic stimulation and a state-space optimal control framework implemented in the thalamocortical circuit of the awake mouse. Approach. Closed-loop optogenetic control of neurons was performed in real-time via stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 expressed in the somatosensory thalamus of the head-fixed mouse. A state-space linear dynamical system model structure was used to approximate the light-to-spiking input-output relationship in both single-neuron as well as multi-neuron scenarios when recording from multielectrode arrays. These models were utilized to design state feedback controller gains by way of linear quadratic optimal control and were also used online for estimation of state feedback, where a parameter-adaptive Kalman filter provided robustness to model-mismatch. Main results. This model-based control scheme proved effective for feedback control of single-neuron firing rate in the thalamus of awake animals. Notably, the graded optical actuation utilized here did not synchronize simultaneously recorded neurons, State-space optogenetic control 2 but heterogeneity across the neuronal population resulted in a varied response to stimulation. Simulated multi-output feedback control provided better control of a heterogeneous population and demonstrated how the approach generalizes beyond single-neuron applications. Significance. To our knowledge, this work represents the first experimental application of state space model-based feedback control for optogenetic stimulation. In combination with linear quadratic optimal control, the approaches laid out and tested here generalize to the multi-input/multi-output control problems necessitated by highly complex neural circuits. More generally, feedback control of neuronal circuits opens the door to adaptively interacting with the dynamics underlying sensory, motor, and cognitive signaling, enabling a deeper understanding of circuit function and ultimately the control of function in the face of injury or disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolus","given":"M F"},{"family":"Willats","given":"A A"},{"family":"Rozell","given":"C J"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"G B"}],"citation-key":"bolus21","container-title":"Journal of neural engineering","DOI":"10.1101/2020.06.25.171785","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,29]]},"page":"036006","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","title":"State-space optimal feedback control of optogenetically driven neural activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.25.171785","volume":"18"},

In all three areas, spike-field coherence in the gamma (40-60 Hz) frequency range was largely confined to the superficial layers,whereas the deep layers showedmaximal coherence at low frequencies (6-16 Hz), which included the alpha range. In the superficial layers of V2 and V4, gamma synchrony was enhanced by attention, whereas in the deep layers, alpha synchrony was reduced by attention. Unlike these major differences in synchrony, attentional effects on firing rates and noise correlation did not differ substantially between the superficial and deep layers.

In addition, individual PFC neurons synchronized to the LFP ensemble corresponding to the current rule (color versus orientation). Furthermore, the ensemble encoding the behaviorally dominant orientation rule showed increased \" alpha\" (6-16 Hz) synchrony when preparing to apply the alternative (weaker) color rule.

  {"id":"buzsaki15","abstract":"Sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) represent the most synchronous population pattern in the mammalian brain. Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during \"off-line\" states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, \"p-ripples,\" which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease.

  {"id":"cannon14","abstract":"Computational models are increasingly important for studying complex neurophysiological systems. As scientific tools, it is essential that such models can be reproduced and critically evaluated by a range of scientists. However, published models are currently implemented using a diverse set of modeling approaches, simulation tools, and computer languages making them inaccessible and difficult to reproduce. Models also typically contain concepts that are tightly linked to domain-specific simulators, or depend on knowledge that is described exclusively in text-based documentation. To address these issues we have developed a compact, hierarchical, XML-based language called LEMS (Low Entropy Model Specification), that can define the structure and dynamics of a wide range of biological models in a fully machine readable format. We describe how LEMS underpins the latest version of NeuroML and show that this framework can define models of ion channels, synapses, neurons and networks. Unit handling, often a source of error when reusing models, is built into the core of the language by specifying physical quantities in models in terms of the base dimensions. We show how LEMS, together with the open source Java and Python based libraries we have developed, facilitates the generation of scripts for multiple neuronal simulators and provides a route for simulator free code generation. We establish that LEMS can be used to define models from systems biology and map them to neuroscience-domain specific simulators, enabling models to be shared between these traditionally separate disciplines.

It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light. Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep brain neurons. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall.

  {"id":"chen18b","abstract":"Optogenetics neuronal targeting combined with single-photon wide-field illumination has already proved its enormous potential in neuroscience, enabling the optical control of entire neuronal networks and disentangling their role in the control of specific behaviors. However, establishing how a single or a sub-set of neurons controls a specific behavior, or how functionally identical neurons are connected in a particular task, or yet how behaviors can be modified in real-time by the complex wiring diagram of neuronal connections requires more sophisticated approaches enabling to drive neuronal circuits activity with single-cell precision and millisecond temporal resolution. This has motivated on one side the development of flexible optical methods for two-photon (2P) optogenetic activation using either, or a hybrid of two approaches: scanning and parallel illumination. On the other side, it has stimulated the engineering of new opsins with modified spectral characteristics, channel kinetics and spatial distribution of expression, offering the necessary flexibility of choosing the appropriate opsin for each application. The need for optical manipulation of multiple targets with millisecond temporal resolution has imposed three-dimension (3D) parallel holographic illumination as the technique of choice for optical control of neuronal circuits organized in 3D. Today 3D parallel illumination exists in several complementary variants, each with a different degree of simplicity, light uniformity, temporal precision and axial resolution. In parallel, the possibility to reach hundreds of targets in 3D volumes has prompted the development of low-repetition rate amplified laser sources enabling high peak power, while keeping low average power for stimulating each cell. All together those progresses open the way for a precise optical manipulation of neuronal circuits with unprecedented precision and flexibility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"I-Wen"},{"family":"Papagiakoumou","given":"Eirini"},{"family":"Emiliani","given":"Valentina"}],"citation-key":"chen18b","collection-title":"Neurotechnologies","container-title":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.conb.2018.03.008","ISSN":"0959-4388","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"179-189","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Towards circuit optogenetics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438817302477","volume":"50"},

A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour.

This has successfully uncovered numerous links between oscillations and cognition or disease. However, neural data are nonsinusoidal, and these nonsinusoidal features are increasingly linked to a variety of behavioral and cognitive states, pathophysiology, and underlying neuronal circuit properties. We present a new analysis framework, one that is complementary to existing Fourier and Hilbert transform-based approaches, that quantifies oscillatory features in the time domain on a cycle-by-cycle basis. We have released this cycle-by-cycle analysis suite as “bycycle,” a fully documented, open-source Python package with detailed tutorials and troubleshooting cases. This approach performs tests to assess whether an oscillation is present at any given moment and, if so, quantifies each oscillatory cycle by its amplitude, period, and waveform symmetry, the latter of which is missed with the use of conventional approaches. In a series of simulated event-related studies, we show how conventional Fourier and Hilbert transform approaches can conflate event-related changes in oscillation burst duration as increased oscillatory amplitude and as a change in the oscillation frequency, even though those features were unchanged in simulation. Our approach avoids these errors. Furthermore, we validate this approach in simulation and against experimental recordings of patients with Parkinson’s disease, who are known to have nonsinusoidal beta (12–30 Hz) oscillations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cole","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Voytek","given":"Bradley"}],"citation-key":"cole19","container-title":"Journal of Neurophysiology","DOI":"10.1152/JN.00273.2019","ISSN":"15221598","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"page":"849-861","PMID":"31268801","publisher":"American Physiological Society","title":"Cycle-by-cycle analysis of neural oscillations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.00273.2019","volume":"122"},

Using a novel approach to extract computational mechanisms from networks trained on neuroscience tasks, here we show that the dimensionality of the dynamics and subpopulation structure play fundamentally complementary roles. Although various tasks can be implemented by increasing the dimensionality in networks with fully random population structure, flexible input–output mappings instead require a non-random population structure that can be described in terms of multiple subpopulations. Our analyses revealed that such a subpopulation structure enables flexible computations through a mechanism based on gain-controlled modulations that flexibly shape the collective dynamics.

Several aspects including challenges for light delivery in living brain tissue, the combination of light delivery with electrophysiological recordings, probe designs, multimodality, wireless implantable system, and practical considerations guiding the choice of configuration depending on the questions one seeks to address are presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Dufour","given":"Suzie"},{"family":"Koninck","given":"Yves De"}],"citation-key":"dufour15","container-title":"Neurophotonics","container-title-short":"NPh","DOI":"10.1117/1.NPh.2.3.031205","ISSN":"2329-423X, 2329-4248","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]},"page":"031205","publisher":"SPIE","source":"www.spiedigitallibrary.org","title":"Optrodes for combined optogenetics and electrophysiology in live animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/neurophotonics/volume-2/issue-3/031205/Optrodes-for-combined-optogenetics-and-electrophysiology-in-live-animals/10.1117/1.NPh.2.3.031205.full","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"dutta19","abstract":"Objective. The ability to modulate neural activity in a closed-loop fashion enables causal tests of hypotheses which link dynamically-changing neural circuits to specific behavioral functions. One such dynamically-changing neural circuit is the hippocampus, in which momentary sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events - ≈ 100 ms periods of large 150-250 Hz oscillations - have been linked to specific mnemonic functions via selective closed-loop perturbation. The limited duration of SWR means that the latency in systems used for closed-loop interaction is of significant consequence compared to other longer-lasting circuit states. While closed-loop SWR perturbation is becoming more wide-spread, the performance trade-offs involved in building a SWR disruption system have not been explored, limiting the design and interpretation of paradigms involving ripple disruption. Approach. We developed and evaluated a low-latency closed-loop SWR detection system implemented as a module to an open-source neural data acquisition software suite capable of interfacing with two separate data acquisition hardware platforms. We first use synthetic data to explore the parameter space of our detection algorithm, then proceed to quantify the realtime in vivo performance and limitations of our system. Main results. We evaluate the realtime system performance of two data acquisition platforms, one using USB and one using ethernet for communication. We report that signal detection latency decomposes into a data acquisition component of 7.5-13.8 ms and 1.35-2.6 ms for USB and ethernet hardware respectively, and an algorithmic component which varies depending on the threshold parameter. Using ethernet acquisition hardware, we report that an algorithmic latency in the range of ≈20-66 ms can be achieved while maintaining <10 false detections per minute, and that these values are highly dependent upon algorithmic parameter space trade-offs. Significance. By characterizing this system in detail, we establish a framework for analyzing other closed-loop neural interfacing systems. Thus, we anticipate this modular, open-source, realtime system will facilitate a wide range of carefully-designed causal closed-loop experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Dutta","given":"Shayok"},{"family":"Ackermann","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Kemere","given":"Caleb"}],"citation-key":"dutta19","container-title":"Journal of Neural Engineering","DOI":"10.1088/1741-2552/aae90e","ISSN":"17412552","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,3]]},"page":"016009","PMID":"30507556","publisher":"IOP Publishing","title":"Analysis of an open source, closed-loop, realtime system for hippocampal sharp-wave ripple disruption","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aae90e","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"evans16","abstract":"Optogenetics has become a key tool for understanding the function of neural circuits and controlling their behavior. An array of directly light driven opsins have been genetically isolated from several families of organisms, with a wide range of temporal and spectral properties. In order to characterize, understand and apply these opsins, we present an integrated suite of open-source, multi-scale computational tools called PyRhO. The purpose of developing PyRhO is three-fold: (i) to characterize new (and existing) opsins by automatically fitting a minimal set of experimental data to three-, four-, or six-state kinetic models, (ii) to simulate these models at the channel, neuron and network levels, and (iii) provide functional insights through model selection and virtual experiments in silico. The module is written in Python with an additional IPython/Jupyter notebook based GUI, allowing models to be fit, simulations to be run and results to be shared through simply interacting with a webpage. The seamless integration of model fitting algorithms with simulation environments (including NEURON and Brian2) for these virtual opsins will enable neuroscientists to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behavior and rapidly identify the most suitable variant for application in a particular biological system. This process may thereby guide not only experimental design and opsin choice but also alterations of the opsin genetic code in a neuro-engineering feed-back loop. In this way, we expect PyRhO will help to significantly advance optogenetics as a tool for transforming biological sciences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Benjamin D."},{"family":"Jarvis","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Schultz","given":"Simon R."},{"family":"Nikolic","given":"Konstantin"}],"citation-key":"evans16","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroinformatics","DOI":"10.3389/fninf.2016.00008","ISSN":"1662-5196","issue":"MAR","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,11]]},"page":"8","publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"PyRhO: A Multiscale Optogenetics Simulation Platform","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fninf.2016.00008/abstract","volume":"10"},

Extraction and analysis of oscillatory features (such as waveform shape and cross-frequency coupling) in such data sets remains difficult. This limits our understanding of brain dynamics and its functional importance. Here, we develop iterated masking empirical mode decomposition (itEMD), a method designed to decompose noisy and transient single-channel data into relevant oscillatory modes in a flexible, fully data-driven way without the need for manual tuning. Based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), this technique can extract single-cycle waveform dynamics through phase-aligned instantaneous frequency. We test our method by extensive simulations across different noise, sparsity, and nonsinusoidality conditions. We find itEMD significantly improves the separation of data into distinct nonsinusoidal oscillatory components and robustly reproduces waveform shape across a wide range of relevant parameters. We further validate the technique on multimodal, multispecies electrophysiological data. Our itEMD extracts known rat hippocampal h waveform asymmetry and identifies subject-specific human occipital a without any prior assumptions about the frequencies contained in the signal. Notably, it does so with significantly less mode mixing compared with existing EMD-based methods. By reducing mode mixing and simplifying interpretation of EMD results, itEMD will enable new analyses into functional roles of neural signals in behavior and disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fabus","given":"Marco S."},{"family":"Quinn","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Warnaby","given":"Catherine E."},{"family":"Woolrich","given":"Mark W."}],"citation-key":"fabus21","container-title":"Journal of Neurophysiology","DOI":"10.1152/jn.00315.2021","ISSN":"15221598","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"page":"1670-1684","PMID":"34614377","publisher":"American Physiological Society","title":"Automatic decomposition of electrophysiological data into distinct nonsinusoidal oscillatory modes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://emd.readthedocs.io","volume":"126"},

We demonstrate serial-parallel photostimulation strategies capable of multi-cell sub-millisecond temporal control and many-fold expansion of the number of activated cells.

  {"id":"fourcaud-trocme03","abstract":"This study examines the ability of neurons to track temporally varying inputs, namely by investigating how the instantaneous firing rate of a neuron is modulated by a noisy input with a small sinusoidal component with frequency (f). Using numerical simulations of conductance-based neurons and analytical calculations of one-variable nonlinear integrate-and-fire neurons, we characterized the dependence of this modulation on f. For sufficiently high noise, the neuron acts as a low-pass filter. The modulation amplitude is approximately constant for frequencies up to a cutoff frequency, fc, after which it decays. The cutoff frequency increases almost linearly with the firing rate. For higher frequencies, the modulation amplitude decays as C/f α, where the power α depends on the spike initiation mechanism. For conductance-based models, α = 1, and the prefactor C depends solely on the average firing rate and a spike \"slope factor,\" which determines the sharpness of the spike initiation. These results are attributable to the fact that near threshold, the sodium activation variable can be approximated by an exponential function. Using this feature, we propose a simplified one-variable model, the \"exponential integrate-and-fire neuron,\" as an approximation of a conductance-based model. We show that this model reproduces the dynamics of a simple conductance-based model extremely well. Our study shows how an intrinsic neuronal property (the characteristics of fast sodium channels) determines the speed with which neurons can track changes in input.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Fourcaud-Trocmé","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Hansel","given":"David"},{"family":"Van Vreeswijk","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Brunel","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"fourcaud-trocme03","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1523/jneurosci.23-37-11628.2003","ISSN":"02706474","issue":"37","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,12,17]]},"page":"11628-11640","PMID":"14684865","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","title":"How Spike Generation Mechanisms Determine the Neuronal Response to Fluctuating Inputs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/37/11628","volume":"23"},

Unfortunately, in rapidly-growing fields like neuroscience, this is becoming increasingly untenable, even for the most conscientious scientists. Thus the merits and limitations of existing models, or whether a new model is an improvement on the state-of-the-art, is often unclear. Software engineers seeking to verify, validate and contribute to a complex software project rely on suites of simple executable tests, called “unit tests”. Drawing inspiration from this practice, we previously developed SciUnit , an easy-to-use framework for developing data-driven “model validation tests” – executable functions, here written in Python. Each such test generates and statistically validates predictions from a model against one relevant feature of empirical data to produce a score indicating agreement between the model and the data. Suites of such validation tests can be used to clearly identify the merits and limitations of existing models and developmental progress on new models. Here we describe NeuronUnit , a library that builds upon SciUnit and integrates with several existing neuroinformatics resources to support the validation of single-neuron models using data gathered by neurophysiologists and neuroanatomists.

We have identified and characterized new ACR homologs in different cryptophyte species, showing that all of them are anion-selective, and thus expanded this protein family to 20 functionally confirmed members. Sequence comparison of natural ACRs and engineered Cl- conducting mutants of cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs) showed radical differences in their anion selectivity filters. In particular, the Glu90 residue in channelrhodopsin 2, which needed to be mutated to a neutral or alkaline residue to confer anion selectivity to CCRs, is nevertheless conserved in all of the ACRs identified. The new ACRs showed a large variation of the amplitude, kinetics, and spectral sensitivity of their photocurrents. A notable variant, designated \"ZipACR\", is particularly promising for inhibitory optogenetics because of its combination of larger current amplitudes than those of previously reported ACRs and an unprecedentedly fast conductance cycle (current half-decay time 2-4 ms depending on voltage). ZipACR expressed in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons enabled precise photoinhibition of individual spikes in trains of up to 50 Hz frequency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Govorunova","given":"Elena G."},{"family":"Sineshchekov","given":"Oleg A."},{"family":"Rodarte","given":"Elsa M."},{"family":"Janz","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Morelle","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Melkonian","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Gane K.S."},{"family":"Spudich","given":"John L."}],"citation-key":"govorunova17","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/srep43358","ISBN":"0021218439","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,3]]},"page":"1-10","PMID":"28256618","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","title":"The Expanding Family of Natural Anion Channelrhodopsins Reveals Large Variations in Kinetics, Conductance, and Spectral Sensitivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43358","volume":"7"},

Although powerful numerical simulators (e.g., NEURON, NEST) exist, data-driven large-scale modeling remains challenging due to difficulties involved in setting up and running network simulations. We developed a high-level application programming interface (API) in Python that facilitates building large-scale biophysically detailed networks and simulating them with NEURON on parallel computer architecture. This tool, termed “BioNet”, is designed to support a modular workflow whereby the description of a constructed model is saved as files that could be subsequently loaded for further refinement and/or simulation. The API supports both NEURON’s built-in as well as user-defined models of cells and synapses. It is capable of simulating a variety of observables directly supported by NEURON (e.g., spikes, membrane voltage, intracellular [Ca++]), as well as plugging in modules for computing additional observables (e.g. extracellular potential). The high-level API platform obviates the time-consuming development of custom code for implementing individual models, and enables easy model sharing via standardized files.

Second, many cells cannot follow ChR2-driven spiking above the gamma (∼40 Hz) range in sustained trains, preventing temporally stationary optogenetic access to a broad and important neural signaling band. Finally, rapid optically driven spike trains can result in plateau potentials of 10 mV or more, causing incidental upstates with information-processing implications.

The effect of various parameters that include irradiance, pulse width, frequency, expression level, and membrane capacitance has been studied in detail. Theoretical simulations are in excellent agreement with recently reported experimental results. The analysis and optimization bring out additional interesting features. A minimal pulse width of 1.7 ms at 23 mW/mm2 induces a peak photocurrent of 1250 pA. Optimal irradiance (0.1 mW/mm2) and pulse width (50 us) to trigger action potential have been determined. At frequencies beyond 200 Hz, higher values of expression level and irradiance result in spike failure. Singlet and doublet spiking fidelity can be maintained up to 400 and 150 Hz, respectively. The combination of expression level and membrane capacitance is a crucial factor to achieve high-frequency firing above 500 Hz. Its optimization enables 100% spike probability of up to 1 kHz.

  {"id":"gutzen18","abstract":"Computational neuroscience relies on simulations of neural network models to bridge the gap between the theory of neural networks and the experimentally observed activity dynamics in the brain. The rigorous validation of simulation results against reference data is thus an indispensable part of any simulation workflow. Moreover, the availability of different simulation environments and levels of model description require also validation of model implementations against each other to evaluate their equivalence. Despite rapid advances in the formalized description of models, data, and analysis workflows, there is no accepted consensus regarding the terminology and practical implementation of validation workflows in the context of neural simulations. This situation prevents the generic, unbiased comparison between published models, which is a key element of enhancing reproducibility of computational research in neuroscience. In this study, we argue for the establishment of standardized statistical test metrics that enable the quantitative validation of network models on the level of the population dynamics. Despite the importance of validating the elementary components of a simulation, such as single cell dynamics, building networks from validated building blocks does not entail the validity of the simulation on the network scale. Therefore, we introduce a corresponding set of validation tests and present an example workflow that practically demonstrates the iterative model validation of a spiking neural network model against its reproduction on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware system. We formally implement the workflow using a generic Python library that we introduce for validation tests on neural network activity data.

  {"id":"hagen18","abstract":"Recordings of extracellular electrical, and later also magnetic, brain signals have been the dominant technique for measuring brain activity for decades. The interpretation of such signals is however nontrivial, as the measured signals result from both local and distant neuronal activity. In volume-conductor theory the extracellular potentials can be calculated from a distance-weighted sum of contributions from transmembrane currents of neurons. Given the same transmembrane currents, the contributions to the magnetic field recorded both inside and outside the brain can also be computed. This allows for the development of computational tools implementing forward models grounded in the biophysics underlying electrical and magnetic measurement modalities. LFPy (LFPy.readthedocs.io) incorporated a well-established scheme for predicting extracellular potentials of individual neurons with arbitrary levels of biological detail. It relies on NEURON (neuron.yale.edu) to compute transmembrane currents of multicompartment neurons which is then used in combination with an electrostatic forward model. Its functionality is now extended to allow for modeling of networks of multicompartment neurons with concurrent calculations of extracellular potentials and current dipole moments. The current dipole moments are then, in combination with suitable volume-conductor head models, used to compute non-invasive measures of neuronal activity, like scalp potentials (electroencephalographic recordings; EEG) and magnetic fields outside the head (magnetoencephalographic recordings; MEG). One such built-in head model is the four-sphere head model incorporating the different electric conductivities of brain, cerebrospinal fluid, skull and scalp. We demonstrate the new functionality of the software by constructing a network of biophysically detailed multicompartment neuron models from the Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration (NMC) Portal (bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal) with corresponding statistics of connections and synapses, and compute in vivo-like extracellular potentials (local field potentials, LFP; electrocorticographical signals, ECoG) and corresponding current dipole moments. From the current dipole moments we estimate corresponding EEG and MEG signals using the four-sphere head model. We also show strong scaling performance of LFPy with different numbers of message-passing interface (MPI) processes, and for different network sizes with different density of connections.

Recently, there has been a focus on incorporating simultaneously measured behaviour into these models to further disentangle sources of neural variability in their latent space. These approaches, however, are limited in their ability to capture the underlying neural dynamics (e.g. linear) and in their ability to relate the learned dynamics back to the observed behaviour (e.g. no time lag). To this end, we introduce Targeted Neural Dynamical Modeling (TNDM), a nonlinear state-space model that jointly models the neural activity and external behavioural variables. TNDM decomposes neural dynamics into behaviourally relevant and behaviourally irrelevant dynamics; the relevant dynamics are used to reconstruct the behaviour through a flexible linear decoder and both sets of dynamics are used to reconstruct the neural activity through a linear decoder with no time lag. We implement TNDM as a sequential variational autoencoder and validate it on simulated recordings and recordings taken from the premotor and motor cortex of a monkey performing a center-out reaching task. We show that TNDM is able to learn low-dimensional latent dynamics that are highly predictive of behaviour without sacrificing its fit to the neural data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hurwitz","given":"Cole"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Akash"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Jude","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Perich","given":"Matthew G"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Lee E"},{"family":"Hennig","given":"Matthias H"}],"citation-key":"hurwitz21","container-title":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","ISBN":"978-1-71384-539-3","ISSN":"10495258","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"29379-29392","title":"Targeted Neural Dynamical Modeling","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://github.com/HennigLab/tndm.","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"jazayeri21","abstract":"The ongoing exponential rise in recording capacity calls for new approaches for analysing and interpreting neural data. Effective dimensionality has emerged as an important property of neural activity across populations of neurons, yet different studies rely on different definitions and interpretations of this quantity. Here, we focus on intrinsic and embedding dimensionality, and discuss how they might reveal computational principles from data. Reviewing recent works, we propose that the intrinsic dimensionality reflects information about the latent variables encoded in collective activity while embedding dimensionality reveals the manner in which this information is processed. We conclude by highlighting the role of network models as an ideal substrate for testing more specifically various hypotheses on the computational principles reflected through intrinsic and embedding dimensionality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Jazayeri","given":"Mehrdad"},{"family":"Ostojic","given":"Srdjan"}],"citation-key":"jazayeri21","container-title":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.conb.2021.08.002","ISSN":"18736882","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]]},"page":"113-120","PMID":"34537579","publisher":"Elsevier Current Trends","title":"Interpreting neural computations by examining intrinsic and embedding dimensionality of neural activity","type":"article-journal","volume":"70"},

In this study, a novel design of an optrode array was proposed for realizing optical modulation and electrophysiological recording.

  {"id":"jha22","abstract":"Active learning seeks to reduce the number of samples required to estimate the parameters of a model, thus forming an important class of techniques in modern machine learning. However, past work on active learning has largely overlooked latent variable models, which play a vital role in neuroscience, psychology, and a variety of other engineering and scientific disciplines. Here we address this gap in the literature and propose a novel framework for maximum-mutual-information input selection for learning discrete latent variable regression models. We first examine a class of models known as \"mixtures of linear regressions\" (MLR). This example is striking because it is well known that active learning confers no advantage for standard least-squares regression. However, we show -- both in simulations and analytically using Fisher information -- that optimal input selection can nevertheless provide dramatic gains for mixtures of regression models; we also validate this on a real-world application of MLRs. We then consider a powerful class of temporally structured latent variable models known as Input-Output Hidden Markov Models (IO-HMMs), which have recently gained prominence in neuroscience. We show that our method substantially speeds up learning, and outperforms a variety of approximate methods based on variational and amortized inference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jha","given":"Aditi"},{"family":"Ashwood","given":"Zoe C."},{"family":"Pillow","given":"Jonathan W."}],"citation-key":"jha22","container-title":"arXiv","DOI":"10.48550/arxiv.2202.13426","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,27]]},"title":"Bayesian Active Learning for Discrete Latent Variable Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13426v1"},

We present a single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions using single-cell long-read sequencing in mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7 (www.isoformAtlas.com). Isoform tests for DIE show better performance than exon tests. We detect hundreds of DIE events traceable to cell types, often corresponding to functionally distinct protein isoforms. Mostly, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. However, for fewer genes, multiple cell types influence DIE. Thus, regional identity can, although rarely, override cell-type specificity. Cell types indigenous to one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, e.g. the choroid plexus epithelium manifests distinct transcription-start-site usage. Spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing yield a spatially resolved splicing map.

A key question then is: how is communication between neural circuits controlled? In motor control, brain areas directly involved in driving movement are active well before movement begins. Muscle activity is some readout of neural activity, yet it remains largely unchanged during preparation. Here we find that during preparation, while the monkey holds still, changes in motor cortical activity cancel out at the level of these population readouts. Motor cortex can thereby prepare the movement without prematurely causing it. Further, we found evidence that this mechanism also operates in dorsal premotor cortex, largely accounting for how preparatory activity is attenuated in primary motor cortex.

Here we investigate a wide range of computational model representations (37 in total), testing their categorization performance and their ability to account for the IT representational geometry. The models include well-known neuroscientific object-recognition models (e.g. HMAX, VisNet) along with several models from computer vision (e.g. SIFT, GIST, self-similarity features, and a deep convolutional neural network). We compared the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) of the model representations with the RDMs obtained from human IT (measured with fMRI) and monkey IT (measured with cell recording) for the same set of stimuli (not used in training the models). Better performing models were more similar to IT in that they showed greater clustering of representational patterns by category. In addition, better performing models also more strongly resembled IT in terms of their within-category representational dissimilarities. Representational geometries were significantly correlated between IT and many of the models. However, the categorical clustering observed in IT was largely unexplained by the unsupervised models. The deep convolutional network, which was trained by supervision with over a million category-labeled images, reached the highest categorization performance and also best explained IT, although it did not fully explain the IT data. Combining the features of this model with appropriate weights and adding linear combinations that maximize the margin between animate and inanimate objects and between faces and other objects yielded a representation that fully explained our IT data.

A long-standing question is whether it is possible to independently activate two distinct neural populations in mammalian brain tissue. Such a capability would enable the study of how different synapses or pathways interact to encode information in the brain. Here we describe two channelrhodopsins, Chronos and Chrimson, discovered through sequencing and physiological characterization of opsins from over 100 species of alga. Chrimson's excitation spectrum is red shifted by 45 nm relative to previous channelrhodopsins and can enable experiments in which red light is preferred.

  {"id":"kokaia13","abstract":"Optogenetic tools comprise a variety of different light-sensitive proteins from single-cell organisms that can be expressed in mammalian neurons and effectively control their excitability. Two main classes of optogenetic tools allow to either depolarize or hyperpolarize, and respectively generate or inhibit action potentials in selective populations of neurons. This opens unprecedented possibilities for delineating the role of certain neuronal populations in brain processing and diseases. Moreover, optogenetics may be considered for developing potential treatment strategies for brain diseases, particularly for excitability disorders such as epilepsy. Expression of the inhibitory halorhodopsin NpHR in hippocampal principal cells has been recently used as a tool to effectively control chemically and electrically induced epileptiform activity in slice preparations, and to reduce in vivo spiking induced by tetanus toxin injection in the motor cortex. In this review we give a comprehensive summary of what has been achieved so far in the field of epilepsy using optogenetics, and discuss some of the possible strategies that could be envisaged in the future. We also point out some of the challenges and pitfalls in relation to possible outcomes of using optogenetics for controlling network excitability, and associated brain diseases.

However, temporal lobe seizures tend to arise from discrete regions before overt clinical behaviour, making temporally and spatially specific treatment theoretically possible. Here we report the arrest of spontaneous seizures using a real-time, closed-loop, response system and in vivo optogenetics in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Either optogenetic inhibition of excitatory principal cells, or activation of a subpopulation of GABAergic cells representing <5% of hippocampal neurons, stops seizures rapidly upon light application.

  {"id":"linden14","abstract":"Electrical extracellular recordings, i.e., recordings of the electrical potentials in the extracellular medium between cells, have been a main work-horse in electrophysiology for almost a century. The high-frequency part of the signal (≳500 Hz), i.e., the multi-unit activity (MUA), contains information about the firing of action potentials in surrounding neurons, while the low-frequency part, the local field potential (LFP), contains information about how these neurons integrate synaptic inputs. As the recorded extracellular signals arise from multiple neural processes, their interpretation is typically ambiguous and difficult. Fortunately, a precise biophysical modeling scheme linking activity at the cellular level and the recorded signal has been established: the extracellular potential can be calculated as a weighted sum of all transmembrane currents in all cells located in the vicinity of the electrode. This computational scheme can considerably aid the modeling and analysis of MUA and LFP signals. Here, we describe LFPy, an open source Python package for numerical simulations of extracellular potentials. LFPy consists of a set of easy-to-use classes for defining cells, synapses and recording electrodes as Python objects, implementing this biophysical modeling scheme. It runs on top of the widely used NEURON simulation environment, which allows for flexible usage of both new and existing cell models. Further, calculation of extracellular potentials using the line-source-method is efficiently implemented. We describe the theoretical framework underlying the extracellular potential calculations and illustrate by examples how LFPy can be used both for simulating LFPs, i.e., synaptic contributions from single cells as well a populations of cells, and MUAs, i.e., extracellular signatures of action potentials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Lindén","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Hagen","given":"Espen"},{"family":"Leski","given":"Szymon"},{"family":"Norheim","given":"Eivind"},{"family":"Pettersen","given":"Klas"},{"family":"Einevoll","given":"Gaute"}],"citation-key":"linden14","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroinformatics","ISSN":"1662-5196","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"LFPy: a tool for biophysical simulation of extracellular potentials generated by detailed model neurons","title-short":"LFPy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2013.00041","volume":"7"},

However, mounting evidence from multiple-electrode recording (and single-trial analyses) shows that the underlying spiking is better characterized by intermittent bursts of activity. A counterargument suggested this intermittent activity is at odds with observations that spike-time variability reduces during task performance. However, this counterargument rests on assumptions, such as randomness in the timing of the bursts, that may not be correct. Thus, we analyzed spiking and LFPs from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys to determine if task-related reductions in variability can co-exist with intermittent spiking. We found that it does because both spiking and associated gamma bursts were task-modulated, not random. In fact, the task-related reduction in spike variability could be explained by a related reduction in gamma burst variability.

However, mounting evidence from multiple-electrode recording (and single-trial analyses) shows that the underlying spiking is better characterized by intermittent bursts of activity. A counterargument suggested this intermittent activity is at odds with observations that spike-time variability reduces during task performance. However, this counterargument rests on assumptions, such as randomness in the timing of the bursts, which may not be correct. Thus, we analyzed spiking and LFPs from monkeys’ prefrontal cortex (PFC) to determine if task-related reductions in variability can co-exist with intermittent spiking. We found that it does because both spiking and associated gamma bursts were task-modulated, not random. In fact, the task-related reduction in spike variability could largely be explained by a related reduction in gamma burst variability. Our results provide further support for the intermittent activity models of working memory as well as novel mechanistic insights into how spike variability is reduced during cognitive tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Lundqvist","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Rose","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Brincat","given":"Scott L."},{"family":"Warden","given":"Melissa R."},{"family":"Buschman","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Herman","given":"Pawel"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Earl K."}],"citation-key":"lundqvist22a","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-18577-y","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,5]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"15050","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Reduced variability of bursting activity during working memory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18577-y","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"luo19","abstract":"We develop a system-level approach to modelling optogenetic-neurons firing behaviour in in-vivo conditions. This approach contains three sub-modules: 1) a Mie/Rayleigh scattering mode of light penetration in tissue; 2) a classic likelihood Poisson spiking train model; 3) a 4-state model of the Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) channel added to a CA3 neuron Hodgkin-Huxley model. We first investigate opto-neurons lightto-spike mechanisms in an in-vivo model: the background noise (synaptic currents) play a dominant role in generating spikes rather than light intensities as for in-vitro conditions (Typically the required light intensity is less than 0.3 mW/mm2 for in-vivo). Then the spiking fidelity is analyzed for different background noise levels. Next, by combining light penetration profiles, we show how neuron firing rates decay as tissue distance increases, for a 2D dimensional cross-section. This preliminary data clearly demonstrate that at given light stimulation protocol, the maximum effected distance in-vivo is 250 μm with small frequency decay rates, while for in-vitro is 50μm with considerable frequency decay rates. Therefore, the developed model can be used for designing sensible light stimulation strategies in-vivo and opto-electronics systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Jun Wen"},{"family":"Nikolic","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Degenaar","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"luo19","container-title":"Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, EMBS","DOI":"10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856664","ISBN":"978-1-5386-1311-5","ISSN":"1557170X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,1]]},"page":"6136-6140","PMID":"31947244","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","title":"Modelling Optogenetic Subthreshold Effects","type":"paper-conference"},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding.

Large-scale multi-electrode recording makes it possible to access these population processes empirically by fitting statistical models to unaveraged data. What statistical structure best describes the concurrent spiking of cells within  a local network? We argue that in the cortex, where firing exhibits extensive correlations in both time and space and where a typical sample of neurons still reflects only a very small fraction of the local population, the most appropriate model captures shared variability by a low-dimensional latent process evolving with smooth dynamics, rather than by putative direct coupling. We test this claim by comparing  a latent dynamical model with realistic spiking observations to coupled generalised  linear spike-response models (GLMs) using cortical recordings. We find that the latent dynamical approach outperforms the GLM in terms of goodness-of-fit, and reproduces the temporal correlations in the data more accurately. We also compare models whose observations models are either derived from a Gaussian or point-process models, finding that the non-Gaussian model provides slightly  better goodness-of-fit and more realistic population spike counts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Macke","given":"Jakob H"},{"family":"Buesing","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Cunningham","given":"John P"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Byron M"},{"family":"Shenoy","given":"Krishna V"},{"family":"Sahani","given":"Maneesh"}],"citation-key":"macke11","container-title":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"publisher":"Curran Associates, Inc.","source":"Neural Information Processing Systems","title":"Empirical models of spiking in neural populations","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2011/hash/7143d7fbadfa4693b9eec507d9d37443-Abstract.html","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"martinez-garcia20","abstract":"Most sensory information destined for the neocortex is relayed through the thalamus, where considerable transformation occurs1,2. One means of transformation involves interactions between excitatory thalamocortical neurons that carry data to the cortex and inhibitory neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) that regulate the flow of those data3–6. Although the importance of the TRN has long been recognised7–9, understanding of its cell types, their organization and their functional properties has lagged behind that of the thalamocortical systems they control. Here we address this by investigating the somatosensory and visual circuits of the TRN in mice. In the somatosensory TRN we observed two groups of genetically defined neurons that are topographically segregated and physiologically distinct, and that connect reciprocally with independent thalamocortical nuclei through dynamically divergent synapses. Calbindin-expressing cells—located in the central core—connect with the ventral posterior nucleus, the primary somatosensory thalamocortical relay. By contrast, somatostatin-expressing cells—which reside along the surrounding edges of the TRN—synapse with the posterior medial thalamic nucleus, a higher-order structure that carries both top-down and bottom-up information10–12. The two TRN cell groups process their inputs in pathway-specific ways. Synapses from the ventral posterior nucleus to central TRN cells transmit rapid excitatory currents that depress deeply during repetitive activity, driving phasic spike output. Synapses from the posterior medial thalamic nucleus to edge TRN cells evoke slower, less depressing excitatory currents that drive more persistent spiking. Differences in the intrinsic physiology of TRN cell types, including state-dependent bursting, contribute to these output dynamics. The processing specializations of these two somatosensory TRN subcircuits therefore appear to be tuned to the signals they carry—a primary central subcircuit tuned to discrete sensory events, and a higher-order edge subcircuit tuned to temporally distributed signals integrated from multiple sources. The structure and function of visual TRN subcircuits closely resemble those of the somatosensory TRN. These results provide insights into how subnetworks of TRN neurons may differentially process distinct classes of thalamic information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Martinez-Garcia","given":"Rosa I."},{"family":"Voelcker","given":"Bettina"},{"family":"Zaltsman","given":"Julia B."},{"family":"Patrick","given":"Saundra L."},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Tanya R."},{"family":"Connors","given":"Barry W."},{"family":"Cruikshank","given":"Scott J."}],"citation-key":"martinez-garcia20","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2512-5","ISSN":"14764687","issue":"7818","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"page":"813-818","PMID":"32699410","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","title":"Two dynamically distinct circuits drive inhibition in the sensory thalamus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2512-5","volume":"583"},

  {"id":"mazzoni15a","abstract":"Leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) network models are commonly used to study how the spiking dynamics of neural networks changes with stimuli, tasks or dynamic network states. However, neurophysiological studies in vivo often rather measure the mass activity of neuronal microcircuits with the local field potential (LFP). Given that LFPs are generated by spatially separated currents across the neuronal membrane, they cannot be computed directly from quantities defined in models of point-like LIF neurons. Here, we explore the best approximation for predicting the LFP based on standard output from point-neuron LIF networks. To search for this best “LFP proxy”, we compared LFP predictions from candidate proxies based on LIF network output (e.g, firing rates, membrane potentials, synaptic currents) with “ground-truth” LFP obtained when the LIF network synaptic input currents were injected into an analogous three-dimensional (3D) network model of multi-compartmental neurons with realistic morphology, spatial distributions of somata and synapses. We found that a specific fixed linear combination of the LIF synaptic currents provided an accurate LFP proxy, accounting for most of the variance of the LFP time course observed in the 3D network for all recording locations. This proxy performed well over a broad set of conditions, including substantial variations of the neuronal morphologies. Our results provide a simple formula for estimating the time course of the LFP from LIF network simulations in cases where a single pyramidal population dominates the LFP generation, and thereby facilitate quantitative comparison between computational models and experimental LFP recordings in vivo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Mazzoni","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Lindén","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Cuntz","given":"Hermann"},{"family":"Lansner","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Panzeri","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Einevoll","given":"Gaute T."}],"citation-key":"mazzoni15a","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1004584","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"e1004584","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Computing the Local Field Potential (LFP) from Integrate-and-Fire Network Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004584","volume":"11"},

Typically, the precise effect of an external action on the ensemble is unknown, since the microscopic description of the oscillators and their interactions are not available. We show that, desynchronization in case of a large degree of uncertainty about important features of the system is nevertheless possible; it can be achieved by virtue of a feedback loop with an additional adaptation of parameters. The adaptation also ensures desynchronization of ensembles with non-stationary, time-varying parameters. We perform the stability analysis of the feedback-controlled system and demonstrate efficient destruction of synchrony for several models, including those of spiking and bursting neurons. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Montaseri","given":"Ghazal"},{"family":"Javad Yazdanpanah","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Pikovsky","given":"Arkady"},{"family":"Rosenblum","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"montaseri13","container-title":"Chaos","DOI":"10.1063/1.4817393","ISSN":"10541500","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,13]]},"page":"033122","PMID":"24089958","publisher":"American Institute of PhysicsAIP","title":"Synchrony suppression in ensembles of coupled oscillators via adaptive vanishing feedback","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4817393","volume":"23"},

We place these findings in the context of the current theoretical understanding of wave generation and propagation in recurrent networks. During the large low-frequency rhythms of sleep or the relatively desynchronized state of the awake cortex, travelling waves may serve a variety of functions, from long-term memory consolidation to processing of dynamic visual stimuli.

It has been estimated that this reduction accounts for a substantial fraction of the attention-mediated improvement in sensory processing. These estimates depend on assumptions about how population signals are decoded and the conclusion that correlated variability impairs perception, is purely hypothetical. Here we test this proposal directly by optogenetically inducing low-frequency fluctuations, to see if this interferes with performance in an attention-demanding task. We find that low-frequency optical stimulation of neurons in V4 elevates correlations among pairs of neurons and impairs the animal’s ability to make fine sensory discriminations. Stimulation at higher frequencies does not impair performance, despite comparable modulation of neuronal responses. These results support the hypothesis that attention- dependent reductions in correlated variability contribute to improved perception of attended stimuli.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Nandy","given":"Anirvan"},{"family":"Nassi","given":"Jonathan J."},{"family":"Jadi","given":"Monika P."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"nandy19","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.35123","ISSN":"2050084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"PMID":"30794156","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications Ltd","title":"Optogenetically induced low-frequency correlations impair perception","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

In basic behavioural tasks, the downsampled magnitude of the 300–1,000 Hz band of spiking activity can predict movement similarly to the threshold crossing rate (TCR) at 30 kilo-samples per second. However, the relationship between such a spiking-band power (SBP) and neural activity remains unclear, as does the capability of using the SBP to decode complicated behaviour. By using simulations of recordings of neural activity, here we show that the SBP is dominated by local single-unit spikes with spatial specificity comparable to or better than that of the TCR, and that the SBP correlates better with the firing rates of lower signal-to-noise-ratio units than the TCR. With non-human primates, in an online task involving the one-dimensional decoding of the movement of finger groups and in an offline two-dimensional cursor-control task, the SBP performed equally well or better than the TCR. The SBP may enhance the decoding performance of neural interfaces while enabling substantial cuts in power consumption.

Optogenetics allows for the first time straightforward targeted neural stimulation with practically no interference between multiple stimulation points since either light beam can be finely confined or the expression of light sensitive ion channels and pumps can be genetically targeted. Here we present a generalised computational modeling technique for various types of optogenetic mechanisms, which was implemented in the NEURON simulation environment. It was demonstrated on the example of a two classical mechanisms for cells optical activation and silencing: channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR).We theoretically investigate the dynamics of the neural response of a layer 5 cortical pyramidal neuron (L5) to four different types of illuminations: 1) wide-field whole cell illumination 2) wide-field apical dendritic illumination 3) focal somatic illumination and 4) focal axon initial segment (AIS) illumination. We show that whole-cell illumination of halorhodopsin most effectively hyperpolarizes the neuron and is able to silence the cell even when driving input is present. However, when channelrhodopsin-2 and halorhodopsin are concurrently active, the relative location of each illumination determines whether the response is modulated with a balance towards depolarization.

  {"id":"peixoto21","abstract":"In dynamic environments, subjects often integrate multiple samples of a signal and combine them to reach a categorical judgment1. The process of deliberation can be described by a time-varying decision variable (DV), decoded from neural population activity, that predicts a subject’s upcoming decision2. Within single trials, however, there are large moment-to-moment fluctuations in the DV, the behavioural significance of which is unclear. Here, using real-time, neural feedback control of stimulus duration, we show that within-trial DV fluctuations, decoded from motor cortex, are tightly linked to decision state in macaques, predicting behavioural choices substantially better than the condition-averaged DV or the visual stimulus alone. Furthermore, robust changes in DV sign have the statistical regularities expected from behavioural studies of changes of mind3. Probing the decision process on single trials with weak stimulus pulses, we find evidence for time-varying absorbing decision bounds, enabling us to distinguish between specific models of decision making.","author":[{"family":"Peixoto","given":"Diogo"},{"family":"Verhein","given":"Jessica R"},{"family":"Kiani","given":"Roozbeh"},{"family":"Kao","given":"Jonathan C"},{"family":"Nuyujukian","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Chandrasekaran","given":"Chandramouli"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Fong","given":"Sania"},{"family":"Ryu","given":"Stephen I"},{"family":"Shenoy","given":"Krishna V"},{"family":"Newsome","given":"William T"}],"citation-key":"peixoto21","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-03181-9","ISSN":"14764687","issue":"7851","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"604-609","PMID":"33473215","title":"Decoding and perturbing decision states in real time","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03181-9","volume":"591"},

  {"id":"qiu20","abstract":"The imbalance of generation and load caused by the increasing integration of volatile generations poses challenges on frequency regulation. AGC is required to respond to the generation fluctuations without violating operational and security constraints. Explicit model predictive control (EMPC) provides an approach to reaching such requirements, which calculates the control laws of MPC in an explicit form, allowing for offline validation of the controller and enabling fast online computation. However, the partition number of EMPC's piecewise affine control laws grows exponentially with the number of constraints and prediction/control horizons, which hinders its application in large systems. In this paper, we propose an alternative explicit control approach for AGC by approximating the control laws of EMPC using Legendre polynomial series expansions, thus entirely eliminating the partition issue. The Galerkin method is applied to the KKT conditions of EMPC's multiparametric quadratic programming (mp-QP) problem to compute the approximation.

At the same time, simulation of large networks is time-consuming and requires huge computational power. The use of spiking neuron models could reduce the computational cost and time. In this study, the extracellular potentials were reconstructed from a single point neuron model of cerebellum granule neuron, and local field potentials (LFP) were modeled. Realistic reconstruction of cerebellum Crus II evoked post-synaptic local field potentials using simple models of granule neurons help to explore emergent behavior attributing patterns of information flow in the granule layer of the cerebellum. The modeling suggests that the evoked extracellular action potential (EAP) arises from the transmembrane currents correlating spiking activity and conductive properties of the extracellular medium to the LFP.

  {"id":"riemenschneider19","abstract":"Purpose: A partial image reconstruction formalism is introduced for the targeted extraction of real-time feedback from arbitrary trajectories when full image reconstruction in real time is computationally too demanding. Methods: Explicit calculation and storage of linear combinations of lines of the reconstruction matrix by an incomplete basis change in spatial coordinates lead to translation of the expensive full reconstruction from a frame-wise application to a region of interest (ROI)-wise application. This step is independent from signal data and can be executed before the experiment. Subsequently, the results of the sum over fully reconstructed voxels can be evaluated directly. Data from a high-speed fMRI acquisition was used to investigate the targeted partial reconstruction of a functional ROI atlas, incorporating an intravolume dephasing correction. The same data and ROIs were used for a comparison of the time series obtained with those obtained from already existing methods for compartment-wise reconstruction. To examine real-time feasibility, the reconstruction was implemented and tested for online reconstruction performance. Results: The reconstruction yields results that are virtually identical to the standard reconstruction (i.e., the magnitude sums over the ROIs), with negligible discrepancies even after termination of the conjugate gradient algorithm at a feasible number of iterations. Notably, more discrepancies arise with existing compartment-wise reconstructions. The online real-time implementation evaluated 1 ROI within 2.8 ms in the case of a highly parallel 3D whole brain acquisition. Conclusion: The high reconstruction fidelity and speed are satisfying for the exemplary application of real-time functional feedback using a highly parallel 3D whole brain acquisition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Riemenschneider","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"LeVan","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Hennig","given":"Jürgen"}],"citation-key":"riemenschneider19","container-title":"Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/mrm.27478","ISSN":"15222594","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"page":"1118-1129","PMID":"30230016","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Targeted partial reconstruction for real-time fMRI with arbitrary trajectories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.27478","volume":"81"},

The challenge to evoke spikes with high spatial and temporal complexity necessitates further joint development of light-delivery approaches and custom opsins. Two-photon (2P) light-targeting strategies demonstrated in-depth generation of action potentials in photosensitive neurons both in vitro and in vivo, but thus far lack the temporal precision necessary to induce precisely timed spiking events. Here, we show that efficient current integration enabled by 2P holographic amplified laser illumination of Chronos, a highly light-sensitive and fast opsin, can evoke spikes with submillisecond precision and repeated firing up to 100 Hz in brain slices from Swiss male mice. These results pave the way for optogenetic manipulation with the spatial and temporal sophistication necessary to mimic natural microcircuit activity.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT To reveal causal links between neuronal activity and behavior, it is necessary to develop experimental strategies to induce spatially and temporally sophisticated perturbation of network microcircuits.

  {"id":"rule18","abstract":"Previous studies on the origin and properties of spatial patterns in motor cortex β-local field potential (β-LFP) oscillations have focused on planar traveling waves. However, it is unclear 1) whether β-LFP waves are limited to plane waves, or even 2) whether they are propagating waves of excito-excitatory activity, i.e., primarily traveling waves in excitable media; they could reflect, instead, reorganization in the relative phases of transient oscillations at different spatial sites. We addressed these two problems in β-LFPs recorded via microelectrode arrays implanted in three adjacent motor cortex areas of nonhuman primates during steady-state movement preparation. Our findings are fourfold: 1) β-LFP wave patterns emerged as transient events, despite stable firing rates of single neurons concurrently recorded during the same periods. 2) β-LFP waves showed a richer variety of spatial dynamics, including rotating and complex waves. 3) β-LFP wave patterns showed no characteristic wavelength, presenting instead a range of scales with global zero-lag phase synchrony as a limiting case, features surprising for purely excito-excitatory waves but consistent with waves in coupled oscillator systems. 4) Furthermore, excito-excitatory traveling waves induced by optogenetic stimulation in motor cortex showed, in contrast, a characteristic wavelength and reduced phase synchrony. Overall, β-LFP wave statistics differed from those of induced traveling waves in excitable media recorded under the same microelectrode array setup. Our findings suggest phase reorganization in neural coupled oscillators contribute significantly to the origin of transient β-LFP spatial dynamics during preparatory steady states and outline important constraints for spatially extended models of β-LFP dynamics in motor cortex. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that a rich variety of transient β-local field potential (β-LFP) wave patterns emerge in motor cortex during preparatory steady states, despite stable neuronal firing rates. Furthermore, unlike optogenetically induced traveling waves, β-LFP waves showed no characteristic wavelength, presenting instead a range of scales with global phase synchrony as a limiting case.

This simulation environment enables the model-based inference of neurophysiological mechanisms across different brain scales that underlie the generation of macroscopic neuroimaging signals including functional MRI (fMRI), EEG and MEG. Researchers from different backgrounds can benefit from an integrative software platform including a supporting framework for data management (generation, organization, storage, integration and sharing) and a simulation core written in Python. TVB allows the reproduction and evaluation of personalized configurations of the brain by using individual subject data. This personalization facilitates an exploration of the consequences of pathological changes in the system, permitting to investigate potential ways to counteract such unfavorable processes. The architecture of TVB supports interaction with MATLAB packages, for example, the well known Brain Connectivity Toolbox. TVB can be used in a client-server configuration, such that it can be remotely accessed through the Internet thanks to its web-based HTML5, JS and WebGL graphical user interface.

  {"id":"saran18","abstract":"© 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). A detailed theoretical analysis of low-power, fast optogenetic control of firing of Chronos-expressing neurons has been presented. A three-state model for the Chronos photocycle has been formulated and incorporated in a fast-spiking interneuron circuit model. The effect of excitation wavelength, pulse irradiance, pulse width, and pulse frequency has been studied in detail and compared with ChR2. Theoretical simulations are in excellent agreement with recently reported experimental results and bring out additional interesting features. At very low irradiances (0.005 mW/mm2), the plateau current in Chronos exhibits a maximum. At 0.05 mW/mm2, the plateau current is 2 orders of magnitude smaller and saturates at longer pulse widths (∼700 ms) compared to ChR2 (∼350 ms). Ipeak in Chronos saturates at much shorter pulse widths (1775 pA at 1.5 ms and 5 mW/mm2) than in ChR2. Spiking fidelity is also higher at lower irradiances and longer pulse widths compared to ChR2. Chronos exhibits an average maximal driven rate of over 200 spikes/s in response to 100 pulses/s stimuli, each of 1-ms pulse-width, in the intensity range 0 to 200 mW/mm2. The analysis is important to not only understand the photodynamics of Chronos and Chronos-expressing neurons but also to design opsins with optimized properties and perform precision experiments with required spatiotemporal resolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Saran","given":"Sant"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Neha"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Sukhdev"}],"citation-key":"saran18","container-title":"Neurophotonics","DOI":"10.1117/1.nph.5.2.025009","ISSN":"23294248","issue":"02","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,24]]},"page":"1","publisher":"SPIE","title":"Theoretical analysis of low-power fast optogenetic control of firing of Chronos-expressing neurons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/neurophotonics/volume-5/issue-2/025009/Theoretical-analysis-of-low-power-fast-optogenetic-control-of-firing/10.1117/1.NPh.5.2.025009.full","volume":"5"},

As our ability to record large neural and behavioral data increases, there is growing interest in modeling neural dynamics during adaptive behaviors to probe neural representations. In particular, neural latent embeddings can reveal underlying correlates of behavior, yet, we lack non-linear techniques that can explicitly and flexibly leverage joint behavior and neural data. Here, we fill this gap with a novel method, CEBRA, that jointly uses behavioral and neural data in a hypothesis- or discovery-driven manner to produce consistent, high-performance latent spaces. We validate its accuracy and demonstrate our tool's utility for both calcium and electrophysiology datasets, across sensory and motor tasks, and in simple or complex behaviors across species. It allows for single and multi-session datasets to be leveraged for hypothesis testing or can be used label-free.

  {"id":"shenoy21","abstract":"Neural recording technologies increasingly enable simultaneous measurement of neural activity from multiple brain areas. To gain insight into distributed neural computations, a commensurate advance in experimental and analytical methods is necessary. We discuss two opportunities towards this end: the manipulation and modeling of neural population dynamics. Neural circuits comprise networks of individual neurons that perform sensory, cognitive, and motor functions. Neuronal biophysics, together with these circuits, give rise to neural population dynamics, which express how the activity of the neural population evolves through time in principled ways. Neural population dynamics provide a framework for understanding neural computation. Prior studies have modeled neural population dynamics to gain insight into computations involved in decision-making, timing, and motor control 1. Here, we present emerging opportunities for new experiments and analyses that use a dynamical systems framework to better understand brain circuits, how they interact, and how they relate to behavior. The simplest model of neural population dynamics is a linear dynamical system (LDS). An LDS (Fig. 1a) is described by a dynamics equation (x(t + 1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)) and an observation equation (y(t) = Cx(t) + d). Typically, y(t) reflects experimental measurements, such as a vector where each element is the number of action potentials fired by a neuron in a brief time bin (e.g., 10 ms). The vector x(t) is a \"neural population state\" that captures information in y(t). This neural population state can be thought of as a representation of the dominant activity patterns in the experimental neural recordings. Typically, x(t) is an abstract representation in a low-dimensional subspace (or manifold) found via dimensionality reduction 2 (Fig. 1b, neural state), reflecting that the neural activity is correlated and the dominant patterns can be described by a relatively small number of variables. The neural population state can also represent the activity of each neuron in the original dimensionality of the measured data (e.g., 100D if 100 neurons). The observation equation relates the observed action potentials (y(t)) to the neural population state (x(t)) through an observation matrix (C). The vector, d, is a constant offset (e.g., to model baseline firing). The neural population state moves through neural state space, constituting a neural population trajectory. The dynamics equation expresses how the neural population state (x(t)) progresses through time as a function of a dynamics matrix (A), an input matrix (B) and https://doi.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Shenoy","given":"Krishna V."},{"family":"Kao","given":"Jonathan C."}],"citation-key":"shenoy21","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-20371-1","ISSN":"20411723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,1]]},"page":"1-5","PMID":"33504773","publisher":"Nature Research","title":"Measurement, manipulation and modeling of brain-wide neural population dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20371-1","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"siegle17","abstract":"Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard ‘open-loop’ visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow.

  {"id":"smith21","abstract":"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful models for processing time-series data, but it remains challenging to understand how they function. Improving this understanding is of substantial interest to both the machine learning and neuro-science communities. The framework of reverse engineering a trained RNN by linearizing around its fixed points has provided insight, but the approach has significant challenges. These include difficulty choosing which fixed point to expand around when studying RNN dynamics and error accumulation when reconstructing the nonlinear dynamics with the linearized dynamics. We present a new model that overcomes these limitations by co-training an RNN with a novel switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) formulation. A first-order Taylor series expansion of the co-trained RNN and an auxiliary function trained to pick out the RNN's fixed points govern the SLDS dynamics. The results are a trained SLDS variant that closely approximates the RNN, an auxiliary function that can produce a fixed point for each point in state-space, and a trained nonlinear RNN whose dynamics have been regularized such that its first-order terms perform the computation, if possible. This model removes the post-training fixed point optimization and allows us to unambiguously study the learned dynamics of the SLDS at any point in state-space. It also generalizes SLDS models to continuous manifolds of switching points while sharing parameters across switches. We validate the utility of the model on two synthetic tasks relevant to previous work reverse engineering RNNs. We then show that our model can be used as a drop-in in more complex architectures, such as LEADS, and apply this LEADS hybrid to analyze single-trial spiking activity from the motor system of a non-human primate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Jimmy T.H."},{"family":"Linderman","given":"Scott W"},{"family":"Sussillo","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"smith21","container-title":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","ISBN":"978-1-71384-539-3","ISSN":"10495258","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,6]]},"page":"16700-16713","title":"Reverse engineering recurrent neural networks with Jacobian switching linear dynamical systems","type":"paper-conference","volume":"20"},

These properties allow relating mental activities to specific brain regions and networks providing a transparent scheme for BCI users to encode information and for real-time fMRI BCI systems to decode the intents of the user. Various mental activities have been used successfully in fMRI BCIs so far that can be classified into the four categories: (a) higher-order cognitive tasks (e.g., mental calculation), (b) covert language-related tasks (e.g., mental speech and mental singing), (c) imagery tasks (motor, visual, auditory, tactile, and emotion imagery), and (d) selective attention tasks (visual, auditory, and tactile attention).

It is not known whether the single-neuron variability is correlated across large neural populations, thus impairing the global encoding of stimuli. We recorded simultaneously from up to 50,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and in higher order visual areas and measured stimulus discrimination thresholds of 0.35° and 0.37°, respectively, in an orientation decoding task. These neural thresholds were almost 100 times smaller than the behavioral discrimination thresholds reported in mice. This discrepancy could not be explained by stimulus properties or arousal states. Furthermore, behavioral variability during a sensory discrimination task could not be explained by neural variability in V1. Instead, behavior-related neural activity arose dynamically across a network of non-sensory brain areas.

To study these processes, we usually rely on averaging across several repetitions of a task or across long segments of data to reach a statistically valid conclusion. Neuronal oscillations reflect synchronized excitability fluctuations in ensembles of neurons and can be observed in electrophysiological recordings in the presence or absence of an external stimulus. Oscillatory brain activity has been viewed as sustained increase in power at specific frequency bands. However, this perspective has been challenged in recent years by the notion that oscillations may occur as transient burst-like events that occur in individual trials and may only appear as sustained activity when multiple trials are averaged together. In this review, we examine the idea that oscillatory activity can manifest as a transient burst as well as a sustained increase in power.

New method: Here, we adopt a different point of view and relate the spiking of neurons to the LFP through efferent synaptic connections and provide a method to calculate LFPs. Results: We show that the so-called unitary LFPs (uLFP) provide the key to such a calculation. We show experimental measurements and simulations of uLFPs in neocortex and hippocampus, for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We fit a “kernel” function to measurements of uLFPs, and we estimate its spatial and temporal spread by using simulations of morphologically detailed reconstructions of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Assuming that LFPs are the sum of uLFPs generated by every neuron in the network, the LFP generated by excitatory and inhibitory neurons can be calculated by convolving the trains of action potentials with the kernels estimated from uLFPs. This provides a method to calculate the LFP from networks of spiking neurons, even for point neurons for which the LFP is not easily defined. We show examples of LFPs calculated from networks of point neurons and compare to the LFP calculated from synaptic currents.

Although using such realistic NEURON models could lead to realistic extracellular potentials, it may require a high computational burden making the simulation of large populations difficult without a workstation. We propose in this paper a novel method to simulate extracellular potentials of firing neurons, taking into account the NEURON geometry and the relative positions of the electrodes.

  {"id":"vila19","abstract":"Objective. Optogenetics provides a means to probe functional connections between brain areas. By activating a set of presynaptic neurons and recording the activity from a downstream brain area, one can establish the sign and strength of a feedforward connection. One challenge is that there are virtually limitless patterns that can be used to stimulate a presynaptic brain area. Functional influences on downstream brain areas can depend not just on whether presynaptic neurons were activated, but how they were activated. Corticofugal axons from the auditory cortex (ACtx) heavily innervate the auditory tectum, the inferior colliculus (IC). Here, we sought to determine whether different modes of corticocollicular activation could titrate the strength of feedforward modulation of sound processing in IC neurons. Approach. We used multi-channel electrophysiology and optogenetics to record from multiple regions of the IC in awake head-fixed mice while optogenetically stimulating ACtx neurons expressing Chronos, an ultra-fast channelrhodopsin. To identify cortical activation patterns associated with the strongest effects on IC firing rates, we employed a closed-loop evolutionary optimization procedure that tailored the voltage command signal sent to the laser based on spike feedback from single IC neurons. Main results. Within minutes, our evolutionary search procedure converged on ACtx stimulation configurations that produced more effective and widespread enhancement of IC unit activity than generic activation parameters. Cortical modulation of midbrain spiking was bi-directional, as the evolutionary search procedure could be programmed to converge on activation patterns that either suppressed or enhanced sound-evoked IC firing rate. Significance. This study introduces a closed-loop optimization procedure to probe functional connections between brain areas.

  {"id":"viswam19","abstract":"Advances in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of devices containing arrays of thousands of closely spaced recording electrodes, which afford subcellular resolution of electrical signals in neurons and neuronal networks. Rationalizing the electrode size and configuration in such arrays demands consideration of application-specific requirements and inherent features of the electrodes. Tradeoffs among size, spatial density, sensitivity, noise, attenuation, and other factors are inevitable. Although recording extracellular signals from neurons with planar metal electrodes is fairly well established, the effects of the electrode characteristics on the quality and utility of recorded signals, especially for small, densely packed electrodes, have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we present a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidating how electrode size, and size-dependent parameters, such as impedance, baseline noise, and transmission characteristics, influence recorded neuronal signals. Using arrays containing platinum electrodes of different sizes, we experimentally evaluated the electrode performance in the recording of local field potentials (LFPs) and extracellular action potentials (EAPs) from the following cell preparations: acute brain slices, dissociated cell cultures, and organotypic slice cultures. Moreover, we simulated the potential spatial decay of point-current sources to investigate signal averaging using known signal sources. We demonstrated that the noise and signal attenuation depend more on the electrode impedance than on electrode size, per se, especially for electrodes <10 μm in width or diameter to achieve high-spatial-resolution readout. By minimizing electrode impedance of small electrodes (<10 μm) via surface modification, we could maximize the signal-to-noise ratio to electrically visualize the propagation of axonal EAPs and to isolate single-unit spikes. Due to the large amplitude of LFP signals, recording quality was high and nearly independent of electrode size. These findings should be of value in configuring in vitro and in vivo microelectrode arrays for extracellular recordings with high spatial resolution in various applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Viswam","given":"Vijay"},{"family":"Obien","given":"Marie Engelene J."},{"family":"Franke","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Frey","given":"Urs"},{"family":"Hierlemann","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"viswam19","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","DOI":"10.3389/fnins.2019.00385","ISSN":"1662453X","issue":"APR","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"385","publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Optimal electrode size for multi-scale extracellular-potential recording from neuronal assemblies","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"wang10","abstract":"A widely recognized shortcoming of model predictive control (MPC) is that it can usually only be used in applications with slow dynamics, where the sample time is measured in seconds or minutes. A well-known technique for implementing fast MPC is to compute the entire control law offline, in which case the on-line controller can be implemented as a lookup table. This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say, no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speed of MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer. As an example, our method computes the control actions for a problem with 12 states, 3 controls, and horizon of 30 time steps (which entails solving a quadratic program with 450 variables and 1284 constraints) in around 5 ms, allowing MPC to be carried out at 200 Hz.

Optogenetic tools have already demonstrated to be of great value in the study of neuronal circuits and in neuromodulation.

Further, to address a spatially distributed sample, independently addressable multiple optical outputs should be present. In current techniques, at least one of these requirements is not fulfilled. In addition to this, it is interesting to directly monitor feedback of the modulation by electrical registration of the activity of the stimulated cells. Here, we present the fabrication and characterization of a fully integrated silicon-based multi-electrode-optrode array (MEOA) for in vitro optogenetics. We demonstrate that this device allows for artifact-free electrical recording. Moreover, the MEOA was used to reliably elicit spiking activity from ChR2-transduced neurons. Thanks to the single cell resolution stimulation capability, we could determine spatial and temporal activation patterns and spike latencies of the neuronal network.

In contrast with neuronal excitation, for which the majority of studies have used a limited number of optogenetic and chemogenetic tools, the number of genetically encoded tools used for inhibition of neuronal activity has vastly expanded. Silencing strategies vary widely in their mechanism of action and in their spatial and temporal scales. Although such manipulations are commonly applied, the design and interpretation of neuronal silencing experiments present unique challenges, both technically and conceptually. Here, we review the most commonly used tools for silencing neuronal activity and provide an in-depth analysis of their mechanism of action and utility for particular experimental applications. We further discuss the considerations that need to be given to experimental design, analysis, and interpretation of collected data. Finally, we discuss future directions for the development of new silencing approaches in neuroscience.

  {"id":"wilmes19","abstract":"Rewards influence plasticity of early sensory representations, but the underlying changes in circuitry are unclear. Recent experimental findings suggest that inhibitory circuits regulate learning. In addition, inhibitory neurons are highly modulated by diverse long-range inputs, including reward signals. We, therefore, hypothesise that inhibitory plasticity plays a major role in adjusting stimulus representations. We investigate how top-down modulation by rewards interacts with local plasticity to induce long-lasting changes in circuitry. Using a computational model of layer 2/3 primary visual cortex, we demonstrate how interneuron circuits can store information about rewarded stimuli to instruct long-term changes in excitatory connectivity in the absence of further reward. In our model, stimulus-tuned somatostatin-positive interneurons develop strong connections to parvalbumin-positive interneurons during reward such that they selectively disinhibit the pyramidal layer henceforth. This triggers excitatory plasticity, leading to increased stimulus representation. We make specific testable predictions and show that this two-stage model allows for translation invariance of the learned representation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilmes","given":"Katharina Anna"},{"family":"Clopath","given":"Claudia"}],"citation-key":"wilmes19","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-12972-2","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,7]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"5055","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Inhibitory microcircuits for top-down plasticity of sensory representations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12972-2","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"witt13","abstract":"Dynamic oscillatory coherence is believed to play a central role in flexible communication between brain circuits. To test this communication-through-coherence hypothesis, experimental protocols that allow a reliable control of phase-relations between neuronal populations are needed. In this modeling study, we explore the potential of closed-loop optogenetic stimulation for the control of functional interactions mediated by oscillatory coherence. The theory of non-linear oscillators predicts that the efficacy of local stimulation will depend not only on the stimulation intensity but also on its timing relative to the ongoing oscillation in the target area. Induced phase-shifts are expected to be stronger when the stimulation is applied within specific narrow phase intervals. Conversely, stimulations with the same or even stronger intensity are less effective when timed randomly. Stimulation should thus be properly phased with respect to ongoing oscillations (in order to optimally perturb them) and the timing of the stimulation onset must be determined by a real-time phase analysis of simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs). Here, we introduce an electrophysiologically calibrated model of Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-induced photocurrents, based on fits holding over two decades of light intensity. Through simulations of a neural population which undergoes coherent gamma oscillations-either spontaneously or as an effect of continuous optogenetic driving-we show that precisely-timed photostimulation pulses can be used to shift the phase of oscillation, even at transduction rates smaller than 25%. We consider then a canonic circuit with two inter-connected neural populations oscillating with gamma frequency in a phase-locked manner. We demonstrate that photostimulation pulses applied locally to a single population can induce, if precisely phased, a lasting reorganization of the phase-locking pattern and hence modify functional interactions between the two populations.","author":[{"family":"Witt","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Palmigiano","given":"Agostina"},{"family":"Neef","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"El Hady","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Fred"},{"family":"Battaglia","given":"Demian"}],"citation-key":"witt13","container-title":"Frontiers in Neural Circuits","DOI":"10.3389/fncir.2013.00049","ISBN":"1662-5110 (Electronic)\\n1662-5110 (Linking)","ISSN":"1662-5110","issue":"April","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"1-17","PMID":"23616748","title":"Controlling the oscillation phase through precisely timed closed-loop optogenetic stimulation: a computational study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncir.2013.00049/abstract","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"yang20","abstract":"The closed-loop brain stimulation technique plays a key role in neural network information processing and therapies of neurological diseases. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an established neuromodulation method for the neural oscillation in animals or human. All available TUS systems provide brain stimulation in an open-loop pattern. In this study, we developed a closed-loop transcranial ultrasound stimulation (CLTUS) system for real-time non-invasive neuromodulation in vivo. We used the CLTUS system to modulate the neural activities of the hippocampus of a wild-type mouse based on the phase of the theta rhythm recorded at the ultrasound-targeted location. In addition, we modulated the hippocampus of a temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) mouse. The ultrasound stimulation increased the absolute power and reduced the relative power of the theta rhythm, which were independent of the specific phase of the theta rhythm. Compared with those of a sham stimulation, the latency of epileptic seizures was significantly increased, while the epileptic seizure duration was significantly decreased under the CLTUS. The above results indicate that the CLTUS can be used to not only modulate the neural oscillation through the theta-phase-specific manipulation of the hippocampus but also effectively inhibit the seizure of a TLE mouse in time. CLTUS has large application potentials for the understanding of the causal relationship of neural circuits as well as for timely, effective, and non-invasive therapies of neurological diseases such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Huifang"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xingran"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xin"}],"citation-key":"yang20","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","DOI":"10.3389/fnins.2020.00445","ISSN":"1662453X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,12]]},"page":"445","publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Closed-Loop Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation for Real-Time Non-invasive Neuromodulation in vivo","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

In experiments with two awake rhesus macaques, we show that the activities of brain networks are modulated by changes in both stimulation amplitude and frequency, that they exhibit damping and oscillatory response dynamics, and that variabilities in prediction accuracy and in estimated response strength across brain regions can be explained by an at-rest functional connectivity measure computed without stimulation.

These oscillatory clusters displayed spatial phase gradients, indicating that they formed traveling waves that propagated at ∼0.25–0.75 m/s. Traveling waves were relevant behaviorally because their propagation correlated with task events and was more consistent when subjects performed the task well.

Using this method, we identified four theta-gamma coupling states in rat hippocampal CA1. These states differed in abundance across behaviors, phase synchrony with other hippocampal subregions, and neural coding properties suggesting that these states are functionally distinct.
