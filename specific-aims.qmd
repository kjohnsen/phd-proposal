# Specific Aims

Mesoscale neuroscience is currently undergoing a revolution fueled by advances in neural manipulation [@fenno11; @wiegert17; @sridharan22; @vierock21; @adesnik21; @faini21; @roth16; @eriksson22] and measurement [@steinmetz21; @siegle17; @gutruf18; @gobel07; @knopfel19; @svoboda06; @kazemipour19; @wu20a] technologies as well as data analysis methods [@maaten08; @berman14; @mathis18; @sani21a; @sporns18; @schneider22]. 
These have yielded unprecedented datasets [@scheffer20; @juavinett19] and insights into network activity and plasticity [@oby19; @yang21; @cowley20; @avitan22; @jazayeri21], as well as novel experimental paradigms such as direct closed-loop control of neural activity [@grosenick15; @kumar13; @potter14; @newman15; @bolus18; @bolus21; @emiliani15; @zhang18; @krook-magnuson13; @witt13; @dutta19]. 


An exciting emerging possibility is closed-loop control of neural activity [cite Grosenick, a bunch of other reviews], enabling intervention in processes that are too fast or unpredictable to control manually or with pre-defined stimulation, such as sensory information processing, motor planning, and oscillatory activity. Unlike other forms of closed-loop control altering the environment [cite examples, mouse knee rotation, visual stimuli to achieve target response,] or using neurofeedback training [cite Diester] to achieve a neural or behavioral target, the direct control of neural activity itself can unambiguously reveal the direct downstream effects of that activity.

Closed-loop control of neural activity can be implemented in an event-triggered sense [cite a bunch of examples, inhibiting seizures, altering power, SWR disruption, ]—enabling the experimenter to respond to discrete events of interest, such as the arrival of a traveling wave [cite Reynolds] or sharp wave ripple [cite some review paper]—or in a feedback sense [cite 2 Bolus papers, all-optical, any others], driving the system towards a target or along a trajectory. The latter has multiple advantages over open-loop control (delivery of a pre-defined stimulus): by rejecting exogenous inputs, noise, and disturbances, it reduces variability across time and across trials, allowing for finer-scale inference. Additionally, it can compensate for model mismatch, allowing it to succeed where open-loop control based on imperfect models is bound to miss the mark.

## Aim 1: An experiment simulation testbed for prototyping closed-loop optogenetic control experiments

## Aim 2: Enabling bidirectional actuation through the application of model-predictive control

## Aim 3: Applying CLOC to control latent population dynamics
