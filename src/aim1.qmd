# Aim 1 - A CLOC simulation testbed {#sec-aim1}

## Rationale

CLOC experiments are difficult and costly.
This can be a barrier to entry for neuroscientists that find CLOC's advantages attractive.
Their lab might lack the funds to invest in necessary hardware or the time to invest in adding high-performance signal processing loop to their experimental workflow.
Or, they may possess the resources but do not want to spend them without some assurance that their proposed experiment would be fruitful.
Finally, when the proposed experiment requires signal processing/control method development, iterating on designs *in-vivo* may be cumbersome, given the additional cost of animal care and training.

Taken together, these factors not only make CLOC experiments a significant investment for a researcher, but one laden with risk.
Unknown properties of the system under study can make it hard to predict whether a proposed experiment (e.g., whether a given population of neurons can be controlled in a given way) is likely to succeed, and even more so when working with innovative methods with little precedent in the literature.

However, these costs and risks can be mitigated through *in-silico* prototyping.
Given a reliable model of the system of interest, one can simulate a proposed experiment, assessing the effectiveness of a given setup.
Alternate models can be tested to assess robustness of the given method to unknown model properties, or a single method can be validated on a variety of models to determine its general applicability.
This strategy not only allows for a researcher to evaluate and optimize methods before committing significant resources to them, but also accelerates the development cycle.

### Innovation
For these reasons, I have developed Cleo: Closed Loop, Electrophysiology, and Optogenetics experiment simulation testbed.
Unlike existing software, Cleo simultaneously provides a high-level interface to fast and flexible neural network simulations; easy, model-independent injection of electrode recording and optogenetic perturbations; and a real-time, closed-loop processing module capable of modeling communication and processing delays inherent in real experiments.
I thus provide a "free trial" to researchers who are unsure if CLOC will serve their research agenda, as well as a low-cost environment to design experiments and develop methods, for those who are already committed to the technqiue.

## Approach

### Guiding principles
Two factors drove our choice of recording and stimulation models to integrate into Cleo.
First, because a main purpose of Cleo is to enable prototyping of experiments, we focused on models at the level of the parameters an experimenter is able to alter.
Because parameters such as electrode location, channel count and density, and optic fiber depth and size are all defined naturally in spatially extended models, Cleo’s electrode and optogenetics modules require a “spatial” network model where relevant neurons must be assigned coordinates in space.

Second, we assumed that highly realistic models of individual neurons are not needed to capture most mesoscale-level phenomena.
Accordingly, Cleo was developed with the intention of using point neurons models, rather than multi-compartment neuron models with realistic morphologies.
Simulating simpler neuron models offers advantages of speed and intuitiveness, which are important in the context of prototyping an experiment.
This decision had consequences in our software (@sec-cleo-arch) and LFP modeling (@sec-elec) decisions.

In addition to our modeling priorities, the goals of usability, flexibility, and extensibility guided our choices in software dependencies and infrastructure.
Ease of use is important to make Cleo as accessible as possible, especially to researchers with primarily experimental backgrounds who may not have extensive experience with computational modeling.
This usability goal also motivated Cleo’s modular design, which allows users to add different recording or stimulation devices with little or no modification to the underlying network model, easing the burden of testing a variety of experimental configurations.
Flexibility in the underlying simulator, in addition to enabling compatibility with a wide variety of models, is necessary for arbitrarily interacting with the simulation in a closed-loop fashion.
Finally, extensibility is important for the testbed to remain relevant under changing needs in the future, allowing for new functionality to be easily added in a "plug-in," modular architecture.


### Closed-loop simulation architecture {#sec-cleo-arch}

![A conceptual diagram of Cleo’s functionality. Cleo wraps a Brian network model, injects stimulation and recording devices, and interfaces with the network in real time through a simulated “I/O processor”.](img/cleo-arch.png){#fig-cleo-arch}

We chose Brian 2 [@stimberg19] as the spiking neural network simulator to build Cleo around.
Brian is a relatively new spiking neural network simulator written in Python with multiple advantages.
It flexibly allows (and even requires) the user to define models mathematically rather than selecting from a pre-defined library of cell types and features, while maintaining the ease of a high-level interface.
This keeps model and experiment details together and enables us to define arbitrary recording and stimulation models that easily interface with the simulation.
Moreover, the Python programming language has the advantages of being open-source, intuitive to learn [@bogdanchikov13], and widely used in computational neuroscience [@davison09; @muller15].
Users do not need to use any other languages to use Brian.
Brian is also relatively fast (especially since it is developed primarily for point neuron simulations), as shown in benchmarks [@stimberg19].

Cleo provides three modules—recording, stimulation, and closed-loop processing—for integration with an existing Brian model (see @fig-cleo-arch).
Cleo’s functionality centers around a `CLSimulator` object that orchestrates the interactions between these three modules and the Brian simulation by injecting devices, running the simulation, and communicating with an `IOProcessor` object at each time step.
The `IOProcessor` receives recorder measurements according to a specified sampling rate and returns any updates to stimulator devices.

In order to simulate the effects of latency in closed-loop control, Cleo provides a `LatencyIOProcessor` class capable of delivering control signals after some delay.
It does this by storing the outputs calculated for every sample in a buffer along with the time they can be delivered to the network.
For example, if a sample is taken at 20 ms and the user wishes to simulate a processing and communication latency of 3 ms, the control signal, along with the output time of 23 ms is stored in a buffer which the simulation checks at every timestep.
As soon as the simulation clock reaches 23 ms, the control signal is taken from the buffer and applied to the stimulator devices.
Because the user has arbitrary control over this latency, they can easily simulate probabilistic delays if, for example, they wish to assess the effect of the experimental platform stalling occasionally.

By default, `LatencyIOProcessor` samples on a fixed schedule and simulates processing samples in parallel—that is, the computation time for one sample does not affect that of others.
Some alternatives are available, as illustrated in @fig-latency.

### Electrode recording {#sec-elec}

#### Spiking
Because we have prioritized point neuron simulations, the electrode functionality currently implemented in Cleo does not rely on raw extracellular potentials, which can only be computed from multi-compartment neurons [@pettersen12; @buzsaki12].
This biophysical forward modeling approach has been taken in other software [@hagen18; @parasuram16; @tomsett15; @thornton19].

To approximate spike recording without filtering and thresholding of extracellular potentials, Cleo simply takes ground-truth spikes and stochastically determines which to report using a detection probability function.
This function is parametrized by a perfect detection radius, within which all spikes are reported, a half detection radius, at which distance there is a 50% chance a spike will be detected, and a cutoff probability, below which all neurons are ignored.
The detection probability function is interpolated between the parametrized points with a $1/r$ function [@nason20; @holt99], where $r$ is the distance between the neuron and the electrode (see @fig-elec).

Cleo provides spike recording functionality in two forms: multi-unit and sorted.
Multi-unit spiking reports every spike detected by every channel, without regard for the origin of the spike.
Thus, each channel can report spikes from multiple neurons and a single spike can be reported on multiple channels.
Sorted spiking reports all spikes detected on at least one channel, where each neuron is identified by a unique index.
While real-time spike sorting is currently not feasible in practice for large numbers of contacts, this sorted spiking option could be used to emulate a common workflow of isolating one or a few neurons to report spikes from in real time.

#### LFP
In order to approximate cortical LFP without recurring to morphological neurons and biophysical forward modeling, we implemented the kernel LFP approximation from [@telenczuk20], which we term TKLFP (Teleńczuk kernel LFP).
This method approximates the per-spike contribution to LFP (termed uLFP: unitary LFP) with a delayed Gaussian function, where amplitude and delay depend on the position of the neuron relative to the electrode.
While the original study included reference peak amplitude $A_0$ values at just four cortical depths, we inferred these values for arbitrary depths by performing cubic interpolation on data from their figure 5 and assumed that this profile dropped to zero at 600 µm below the soma and 1000 µm above.
This implementation is available as a standalone Python package on PyPI [@johnsen22].
Accuracy of this implementation is verified in automated test suites in both TKLFP and Cleo packages.

### Optogenetic stimulation

#### Light model
Cleo simulates optogenetic stimulation by combining a model of light propagation with an opsin model relating light to current.
The light model is taken from [@foutz12] and uses Kubelka-Munk light propagation.
This is a simplified model operating on the assumption that the medium is optically homogeneous, which, while not true, was shown by Foutz et al.
to be a suitable approximation.
Cleo includes absorbance, scattering, and refraction parameters for blue, 473-nm light as given in [@foutz12].

#### Opsin models
Independent of the light propagation model, Cleo provides two different opsin models.
One is a four-state Markov model as presented in [@evans16], which captures rise, peak, plateau, and fall dynamics as the opsin is activated and deactivated through a Markov process.
Additionally, by defining conductance rather than current directly, the model is able to reproduce the photocurrent’s dependence on the membrane potential (see @fig-opto).
While the four-state model fits experimental data fairly well, the code is structured so that the three- or six-state models in [@evans16]
could also be easily implemented.

Because the Markov model depends on somewhat realistic membrane potential and resistance values, however, it is not well suited for many pre-existing models that do not.
For example, many commonly used leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons define the membrane potential as ranging from 0 to 1, rather than -70 mV to -50 mV, rendering both the units and values (relative to the opsin’s reversal potential) incompatible.
One solution would be for users to adapt their neuron models for compatibility with this Markov opsin model, but since this would be burdensome, we developed an alternative model that simply delivers photocurrent proportional to the light intensity at each neuron.
Thus, users can retain their original model with no need to add units or modify parameters.

In addition to options for opsin modeling, Cleo allows the user to specify both the probability that cells of a target population express an opsin and the per-cell expression level.
This allows for the study of the impact of heterogeneous expression on the outcome of an experiment.


## Results
### Model validation
The light model from [@foutz12] was successfully replicated, and the light intensity-firing rate relationship was qualitatively similar to that originally reported, though differing in some respects.
This can be attributed to the use of point neurons rather than morphological neurons.
See @fig-opto for details.
Additionally, preliminary experiments show that the simplified, proportional current opsin model is able to produce a firing response qualitatively similar to that of the Markov model.

### Example experiments {#sec-cleo-experiments}
In order to demonstrate Cleo's utility to the public, we implemented three example experiments to feature in the upcoming publication:

1. Closed-loop inhibition of a traveling wave in a rodent somatosensory cortex model [@moldakarimov18].
   This experiment features a simple on/off control scheme where light activating an inhibitory opsin is turned on whenever the number of spikes detected at the optrode exceeds a threshold.
   The result is that while a wave of activity spreads outward through sensory cortex in response to a stimulus, the area around the optrode remains unperturbed.
   An experiment of this sort could explore the consequences of traveling waves in sensory cortex on perception.
2. Feedback control of layer 2/3 interneurons, disrupting plasticity in a model of primary visual cortex [@wilmes19].
   In this model, a top-down reward signal to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons inhibits a population of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, in turn disinhibiting a population of pyramidal cells (PC).
   However, using a proportional-integral (PI) feedback controller, we clamp the firing rate of interneurons, blocking this disinhibtion.
   Without increased PC firing, synaptic weights corresponding to the rewarded stimulus no longer increase, thus demonstrating how feedback control can disrupt normal circuit function.
3. Optogenetic evocation of sharp wave-ripples in an anatomically detailed model of hippocampus [@aussel18; @aussel22]. 
   This uses linear quadratic regulator control to evoke a reference sharp wave-ripple LFP signature.
   See @fig-hpc for details, and note that feedback control, not looking ahead, so to speak, fails to evoke the reference signal at the desired time.
   The strategy I propose in @sec-aim2 should remedy this.

The model consists of four regions, entorhinal cortex (EC), dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1.
Electrode contacts are represented as black dots and are in the same location as in the original model.
Two light sources are shown in EC.
Nine other such pairs (for a total of 20 light sources) not pictured here were spaced regularly parallel to the z axis.
(B) Results are shown for ten trials each of three stimulation paradigms: naïve open-loop, where the input is simply a mirrored, rectified version of the reference signal; model-based open-loop, where a controller is run offline on a simulated model; and feedback control, where a controller is run using online measurements.
Input $\text{Irr}_0$ is the light intensity at the tip of each optic fiber.
The system output TKLFP refers to the Teleńczuk kernel LFP approximation.

### Open-source code and documentation
Cleo is open-source and can be installed from the Python Package Index under the name `cleosim`. The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sensory-Information-Processing-Lab/Cleo). Documentation, including an overview, tutorials, and API reference, can be found at <https://cleosim.readthedocs.io>. 


## Limitations
### Guiding principles
Because we prioritize point neuron models, Cleo does not currently provide tools for recording realistic extracellular potentials.
This would preclude realistically simulating such methods as spike sorting.
Currently, the sorted spikes signal Cleo can record assumes perfect sorting but could be made more realistic by adding sorting noise.

### Closed-loop simulation architecture
One downside of using Brian is that it does not have the same first-class support for multi-compartment neurons as the popular NEURON [@hines97] simulator.
Using point neurons precludes advanced, morphology-dependent features of neural dynamics as well as recording and stimulation.
However, if this feature is needed, Cleo could be developed further to integrate with Brian's morphological neuron features.

Both a strength and a limitation of Cleo's design is that it depends on whatever model the user provides.
This avoids the pitfall of painstakingly developing stock models may or may not prove useful to researchers and instead lets them identify or develop a model that adequately describes the phenomena being studied. 
If a sufficiently realistic model for the studied system does not exist, however, developing one may be prohibitively costly, becoming a computational project in its own right as opposed to simply a stepping-stone towards an experiment.
In these cases we suggest that a workaround could be to test a variety of potential models to identify which experimental configurations would be robust to unknown properties of the system.
Indeed, the desired experiment in this case could be one that best adjudicates between these hypotheses [@willats-clinc].

### Electrodes
Using point neurons requires approximation of extraceullar potentials, which do not perfectly match ground-truth signals.
The TKLFP approximation Cleo uses, for example, underrepresents high-frequency signals.
Fortunately, there is an alternate, potentially more accurate, LFP approximation for point neurons that can be added to Cleo in the future if needed [@mazzoni15a] and which we are implementing now.

### Optogenetics
Currently only channelrhodopsin-2 model parameters are included—comparing the effectiveness of different opsins will require first obtaining parameters. This is important since new opsins have been engineered with improved characteristics [@gunaydin10; @lin13; @klapoetke14; @hochbaum14; @mager18; @sridharan22; @kishi22], as well as chloride pumps [@gradinaru10; @chuong14; @berndt16], channels [@govorunova15; @govorunova17], and  other innovations [@berndt16; @vierock21]]. Thankfully, parameters for many opsins are available in published literature [@saran18; @gupta19a; @bansal20; @bansal20b; @bansal21a].

Another limitation is support for multiple simultaneous opsins or light sources. At present, the user could manually include separate current terms for each opsin in neuron model equations or approximate spectral overlap by adding a fraction of a light source’s intensity to that of another, but this potentially slow workflow is antithetical to Cleo’s goal of requiring minimum work to test different scenarios. We plan on adding this functionality shortly, since it will be important for Aims 2 and 3.

## Summary of contributions
Thus, I have developed Cleo, a simulation environment facilitating and accelerating the adoption and development of CLOC methods.
Multiple features were designed to reflect this need, for example, neural simulation and experimental configuration at an intermediate level of realism, relevant recording and stimulation modalities, modular software architecture, flexible interfacing that can be easily adapted to existing Brian models, and arbitrary closed-loop processing enabling realistic processing delays.
Moreover, designing Cleo to help experimental labs to test and potentially adopt CLOC methods, we have developed virtual experiments to serve as examples as well as thorough online documentation.
