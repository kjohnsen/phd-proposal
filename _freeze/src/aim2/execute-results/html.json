This allows us to continue to use simple and fast LQR methods but fails to model inhibitory and excitatory opsins separately and precludes alternate light configurations, where there are not excitatory/inhibitory pairs each one overlapping little with others.\n\n### Innovation\nI propose addressing this problem using model predictive control (MPC), which is widely used for its flexibility in implementing optimal control with constraints.\nRather than computing the control signal from the current error signal at each step, MPC looks ahead, optimizing over the predicted trajectory some finite number of steps into the future, in what is known as \"receding horizon control.\"\nThe downside is that this requires solving an optimization problem (a quadratic program for straightforward linear dynamical systems) at every control step, which is more costly than the matrix operations typical of LQR.\nThe latency caused by this computation causes real-time control performance to suffer.\nEven so, I hypothesize that MPC will be able to better optimize multi-input optogenetic stimulation while accommodating experimental constraints and considerations during real-time control on timescales relevant to network-level descriptions of neural activity.\nI plan to achieve this aim by adapting previously demonstrated linear models, adding input constraints and costs, and assessing control quality of MPC compared to the heuristic LQR approach previously described as I simulate multi-output feedback control of firing rates and gamma oscillations observed in local field potentials (LFP).\n\n:::{#fig-mpc}\n::::{.dark-invert}\n![](img/mpc-schematic.png){style='padding:.5em;

@kokaia13; @stujenske15].\nThis could be added to the linear dynamics and quadratic cost functions without changing the optimization methods, but, as with opsin and channel count, the increased size of the problem could change which configuration performs best.\nI will also test open-loop, heuristic LQR, and MPC approaches to see whether MPC attains better performance despite a longer computational delay, as hypothesized.\nControl algorithm computation time will be measured and used during simulations as a realistic delay.\nTo evaluate controller performance, I will use metrics such as the mean-squared error (MSE) between the reference firing rate and the Gaussian window-smoothed firing rate of the spikes received by the controller during the trial.\n\nIn the first experiment, I will simulate multi-output control of firing rates in an attempt to clamp population activity.\n@wagenaar05 and @newman13 laid the foundation for this by clamping aggregate, population firing rates, and @bolus21 took this further by treating firing rates of individual neurons separately, though with a single optic fiber input.\nThis is an obvious case where multiple inputs should provide more control, allowing us to manipulate neurons (or groups of neurons in the case of unsorted threshold crossings) more individually, each to its own baseline.\nThe experiment will be performed on a Poisson linear dynamical system (PLDS) model [@macke11] fit to optogenetic input/spike output data from a spiking neural network (SNN) model.\nThe SNN model will contain necessary features, such as cell types, time-varying exogenous input, and connectivity profiles, to produce stochastic firing patterns with unpredictable disturbances.\n\nAs another experiment, I propose another form of network-level control---manipulating the oscillatory signatures found in LFP signals.\n\nAll experiments will be performed on a simulated randomly connected network of excitatory and inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons or a Poisson linear dynamical system [@macke11] model fit to simulated data.\nThe framework of Aim 1 will be leveraged to simulate electrode recording and optogenetic stimulation, and spikes from individual neurons will be used as inputs to the controller.\nIn all experiments I will compare my MPC approach to the unconstrained LQR controller developed previously [@bolus21].\nI will also compare to an optimal open-loop stimulus computed over a whole-trial horizon.\nNoise will be provided to the network where needed to simulate an external disturbance.\n\n### Preparation for real-time experiments\nTo inform future experiments where compute time is crucial for control performance, I will record compute time of LQR and MPC approaches for varying numbers of input and output channels $k$ and $m$. \nFor instance, the time required to solve the quadratic program for MPC would provide a preliminary estimate of the minimum control period we may want to use when implementing MPC in real time.\nTo get a better idea of how this compute latency might affect a real experiment, I will also test multi-input MPC on a more realistic simulation, such as one of the example experiments from @sec-cleo-experiments, leveraging the latency simulation capabilities of the CLOC simulation framework.\n\n## Expected results\nI expect that bidirectional control will be perform better than unidirectional control at the aforementioned tasks of clamping baseline activities and following a dynamic reference trajectory.\nI also expect that MPC will attain higher performance than LQR for all multi-input conditions and especially in the case of a dynamic reference.\nWhile MPC will be considerably slower than LQR, it should be fast enough for control of neural phenomena on the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds.\n\n## Preliminary results\nBasic simulations controlling a linear dynamical system model fit to experimental data show the advantages of bidirectional control and of MPC (see @fig-mpc-sim).\nBidirectional actuation allows the system to avoid overshooting the reference, in the case of LQR, or to minimize error faster by first exciting then inhibiting, in the case of MPC.\nMPC's advantages in looking ahead also clearly allow it to follow the reference more closely than the heuristic LQR controller (assigning negative inputs to the second light source).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n![Simulated control of an linear dynamical system with 1- and 2-input control, using LQR and MPC controllers.
