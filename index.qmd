# Abstract
As the importance of causal inference becomes increasingly recognized in neuroscience, the need for technology enabling precise manipulation of neural variables becomes apparent.
Feedback control is an important class of such manipulations for its ability to increase inference power by reducing response variability.
Widely used throughout the engineering disciplines, it has had a significant impact through a variety of techniques (e.g., voltage clamp, dynamic clamp) on cellular neuroscience.
However, feedback control has yet to be widely applied at the mesoscale/circuit level despite recent improvements in interfacing technology, such as optogenetics.
Challenges to adoption include the complexity of implementing fast closed-loop experiments, the need to adapt the mature methods of control theory to the idiosyncratic constraints of systems neuroscience experiments, and the lack of established technical guidelines for applying feedback control to address complex scientific questions.

In this work I propose to begin to address these challenges in three aims.
In Aim 1, I develop a simulation framework for easily prototyping closed-loop optogenetic control (CLOC) experiments *in silico*, thus allowing neuroscientists to test and iterate on experimental designs without the costs of in-vivo experiments or up-front investments in hardware-software systems.
In Aim 2, I will translate sophisticated model-based feedback control algorithms to the experimental setting of multi-input CLOC---the simultaneous use of multiple light sources and/or opsins---and test the virtues of more powerful and complex algorithms compared to the limited, simpler ones previously used.
Finally, in Aim 3, I will explore how control quality varies with experimental parameters in a promising future application of CLOC---controlling the latent dynamics of neural population activity---and test the hypothesis that per-neuron actuation will not be needed.
I will do this *in silico* with recurrent spiking neural networks trained using state-of-the-art, biologically plausible methods and differing degrees of brain-like structure.
This work will thus equip the systems neuroscience community to more fully take advantage of CLOC with an accessible testing and development environment, multi-input actuation, and a point of reference for designing experiments capable of answering complex scientific questions.
