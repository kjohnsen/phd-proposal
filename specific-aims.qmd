# Specific Aims
As the importance of causal inference becomes increasingly recognized in neuroscience, the need for technology enabling precise manipulation of neural variables becomes apparent.
Feedback control is an important class of such manipulations for its ability to increase inference power by reducing response variability.
Widely used throughout the engineering disciplines, it has had a significant impact through a variety of techniques (e.g., voltage clamp, dynamic clamp) on cellular neuroscience.
However, feedback control also has great potential at the mesoscale/systems level, promising the ability to *unambiguously infer the downstream effects of circuit/population-level neural activity*.

For a number of reasons, though, *this potential has not been realized*, as feedback control has not yet been widely applied in systems neuroscience.
The main challenges to wider adoption do not appear to lie with available technology, as the computational power and stimulation/recording requirements of feedback control are met by the ever-improving tools already available to neuroscientists, such as optogenetics and large-scale neural recording.
I posit that the main challenges to adoption rather include the **complexity of implementing** fast closed-loop experiments, the need to **adapt the mature methods of control theory** to the idiosyncratic constraints of systems neuroscience experiments, and the **lack of established technical guidelines** for applying feedback control to address complex scientific questions.
**The proposed work aims to begin to address these challenges, and thus strengthen the set of causal tools available to probe neural systems.**

## Aim 1: A CLOC experiment simulation testbed
One significant obstacle to closed-loop optogenetic control (CLOC) experiments is the cost of acquiring and configuring compatible hardware-software systems. 
Moreover, the maintenance of animals or cell cultures inherent in any _in-vivo_ or _in-silico_ can slow the pace of developing novel experimental techniques.
In Aim 1, I attempt to address these obstacles by developing a simulation framework for easily prototyping CLOC experiments _in silico_, thus enabling faster, cheaper CLOC experiment design and method development.
We demonstrate the software's utility in different virtual experiments and provide it to the public as open-source software with thorough documentation.

## Aim 2: Bidirectional CLOC
In Aim 2, I will translate sophisticated model-based feedback control algorithms to the realistic experimental setting of bidirectional CLOC—the simultaneous use of both excitatory and inhibitory opsins.
I will demonstrate some advantages of bidirectional CLOC and how it is not well accommodated by the algorithms previously demonstrated.

## Aim 3: Using CLOC to manipulate latent neural dynamics
Finally, in Aim 3, I will explore how recording, stimulation, and control requirements vary in an example application of CLOC—controlling the latent dynamics of simulated neural population activity and assessing their causal relationship with behavior.
I will model this population activity with recurrent spiking neural networks trained using state-of-the-art, biologically plausible methods, with differing degrees of brain-like architecture and task complexity.
